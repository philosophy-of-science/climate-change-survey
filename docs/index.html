          <h2>Survey Results Summary</h2>
          <p>
            During March 2021, the
            <a href="https://www.philsci.org/sustainability_climate_task.php">
              Philosophy of Science Association Climate Task Force
            </a>
            (CTF) issued a survey aimed at gathering information on
            members&apos; experiences of working in a more online environment as
            a result of the Coronavirus crisis, and gauging attitudes towards
            continuing with some of these practices in the service of the
            climate crisis. Many other learned societies are currently asking
            similar questions. The full results of this survey are now available
            via the members&apos; area of the website.

            In the end almost 200 (189) of the PSA&rdquo;s roughly 700 current
            members took the survey. Overall the results show a marked desire
            among the membership for a substantial decarbonization of the
            discipline. In particular:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Over half of respondents (57%) said that, given IPCC goals, they
              would like to reduce the carbon footprint associated with their
              research activity by 50% or more. A further 28% were interested in
              reducing it to some degree.
            </li>
            <li>
              Over half of respondents (51%) said that, given IPCC goals, they
              would like to see many conferences and workshops continue to be
              hosted online.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Respondents were however less sure about whether online conferences
            should be the &ldquo;default&rdquo; for conferences involving
            geographically remote participants, with the move to in-person only
            when there is &ldquo;good reason&rdquo;: the result here was a
            pretty even split between &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and
            &ldquo;Unsure.&rdquo; As such, it seems clear that as a community
            there is considerable enthusiasm for moving to a more online model,
            but less clarity on the circumstances in which one model should be
            chosen over another.
          </p>

          <div class="content__sidebar">
            <p>More on the Default stance</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a
                  href="https://dailynous.com/2021/01/11/online-conferences-new-default-guest-post/"
                  >Online Conferences: The New Default</a
                >

              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            Noteworthy also was that a sizeable majority of respondents (68%)
            agreed with the statement that &ldquo;even if many conferences and
            workshops should continue to be hosted online, there is special
            reason to host the PSA biennial meeting remotely.&rdquo; This
            obviously raises the question of how the PSA itself can reduce the
            carbon burden imposed by its activities. It also raises the question
            of how the PSA meeting might be re-envisioned to better serve the
            role of bringing people together in-person when there is less of
            that going on overall.
          </p>

          <p>
            Summing up, it seems that many in our community envision us going
            forward roughly as follows: the PSA biennial meeting will be
            maintained as at least partly in-person, while smaller meetings will
            largely, although not wholly, be conducted online in the interests
            of decreasing our collective carbon footprint.
            <em
              >We would like those who organize conferences and workshops to be
              aware that this is how many members of our community wish to
              proceed.</em

            <h3>Problems with Online Meetings</h3>

            <p>
              While the reported quantitative data shows broad support for a
              more online conference model – the PSA meeting aside – qualitative
              survey responses make clear that some regard the online model as a
              very pale imitation of in-person meetings. And as may be seen from
              the answers to Question 2 and 6, it was the social aspect of these
              meetings together with &ldquo;Zoom fatigue&rdquo; that were seen
              as prime respects in which they fell short. Some respondents also
              enumerated ways in which online meetings did not always better
              serve those with care obligations or accessibility constraints.
              While some of the problems posed by online meetings might be
              reduced in a post-pandemic setting (given that e.g. office space
              will again be available to many of us and overall we will be on
              Zoom less), it is clear nevertheless that moving to a much more
              online model will discriminate against some in our community at
              the same time as it helps others. This obviously poses a dilemma
              given widespread support for making significant cuts to our carbon
              consumption that the community needs to address. As such, it seems
              that we as a community should carefully reflect upon questions
              such as:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                which situations warrant a reversion to carbon costly forms of
                meeting;
              </li>
              <li>
                how professional relationships between geographically distant
                scholars can be instigated and fostered without physical travel,
                particularly in the case of early-career scholars;
              </li>
              <li>
                how both sorts of meetings might be combined so as to achieve
                something of the &ldquo;best of both worlds&rdquo;.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Regarding the latter question, in addition to the familiar (and
              sometimes prohibitively expensive) &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; model,
              some researchers have been working with a &ldquo;hub&rdquo; model
              in which multiple groups of scholars convene locally and then
              interact with distant such groups online (see for example
              <a
                href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02057-2?MvBriefArticleId=15318"
              >
                this article in <em>Nature</em></a
              >). This is a model that philosophers of science may wish to
              experiment with. In the near future, the CTF and our partner
              organization
              <a href="https://www.philosophersforsustainability.com/"
                >Philosophers for Sustainability</a

            <h3>Controversies Surrounding Effectiveness</h3>

            <p>
              It should be noted finally that some respondents felt that the
              focus on academic travel was misguided, and one that ran the risk
              of diverting attention away from other areas where we might more
              purposefully direct efforts against climate change. Some expressed
              the worry that these sorts of &ldquo;individualistic&rdquo;
              actions might actively undermine efforts to promote more
              systematic change, and saw the survey as a wasted opportunity to
              consider what other sorts of actions we could take as a society.
              While it is well-established that conference travel comprises a
              very significant portion of research-related carbon emissions (by
              UBC&apos;s measure, somewhere between 63 and 73% of the total
              associated with all campus operations), the question of the
              effectiveness of these sorts of interventions is a complicated one
              lacking any uncontroversial responses. Suffice to say here that
              for all these controversies, the survey results make clear that a
              majority of respondents do, as a matter of fact, want to
              significantly cut their research-related carbon footprint. While
              acknowledging that not everyone feels the same way, we take it
              those wishes ought to be respected by all in our community, and
              ideally in a way that minimizes the professional harms suffered by
              those who wish to travel less. As such, even those who have no
              such intention should consider how they can further the interests
              of those who do, such as by advocating for facilities for remote
              participation at the conferences that they organize.

              These issues, together with other ways that the PSA can help in
              the climate fight, will be the topic of the President&apos;s Forum
              at the 2021 meeting in Baltimore. The CTF would like to thank
              everyone who contributed to the survey. Special thanks also go to
              PSA Associate Caitlin Powell for handling the survey and for
              packaging the results. Questions, suggestions, or requests for
              information may be directed to the PSA CTF chair, Kerry McKenzie
              (<a href="mailto:kmckenzie@ucsd.edu">kmckenzie@ucsd.edu</a>).
