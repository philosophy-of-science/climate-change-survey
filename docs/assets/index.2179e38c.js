Close to worthless.","Many of its key functions surrounding networking and collegiality occur in person.","I can only speak for myself and respect that others will have reasons for wanting to continue to meet in person.","If I only ever go to one conference in person again, it should be the PSA. I will go virtual for every single one, except this. There is no replacement for an in-person PSA.","See comment above.","I think there should be space for in-person conferences. Zoom is just not the same. However, I take it that small workshops, symposiums for particular issues, etc., are all movable online (with the benefit of having larger audiences than in-person). The big conferences already attract lots of people. But they are more costly environmentally. So I think moving most small conferences online (something PSA can only promote and suggest) and keeping some big conferences in-person (e.g., having every other biennal conference in-person) would reduce to 50% the carbon footprint without totally eliminating the benefits of in-person conferences.","I think we should have more conferences online, but not all. I would be very disappointed if the PSA went fully virtual, because it's my favorite large conference in terms of after-hours networking and socializing. Since it's the primary opportunity for philosophers of science to connect with one another, and since it's only held once every two years, I have a strong preference for keeping it F2F. I'd also like to mention that I think in-person meetings have a special importance for graduate students and early-career scholars. There's a higher barrier to meeting new people when things are virtual, and this is especially felt by less well-connected folks. Moreover, well-established senior faculty with busy schedules might appreciate the convenience of an online conference, but it makes them less accessible to relative outsiders.","I have spent a very lonely year at home alone. Zoom has been a necessary way to continue professional collaboration and has work well for departmental colloquia lasting no more than two hours. But conferences have not been as pleasant. I thought the PSA poster virtual format worked fairly well, but some posters were difficult to see because the fonts were too small. Also, I would have liked to walk around in a conference hall to chat more with some of the individual poster presenters. I really missed all the PSA activities, such as the special interest lunches, seeing everyone together at the Awards and Presidential Address, going to sessions in my areas of interest and hearing the talks and questions live, talking to colleagues from around the world at receptions, going out for dinner with friends I only see at PSA meetings, browsing at the book exhibit. I do hope we can meet in Baltimore in the fall.","The value of socialising and informal interaction is less in a bigger meeting such as the PSA biennial conference than in smaller more focused workshops. So I actually think this is the kind of conference that could reasonably go online.",'I don\'t find that I make "connections" remotely with large groups. There is no real way to "circulate" at a mixer to meet younger scholars, for example, so I haven\'t met as many this past year as usual. I always introduce myself to younger folks in a room, but I can\'t really do that (or don\'t know how) from a Zoom meeting. We have discussed this in our program, and we agree that virtual formats lead to less diversity and inclusion in many ways, even while allowing more people to "log on."',"One reason is that online socializing doesn't even work half as well as in-person socializing. It's important for everyone (and in particular for junior scholars) to have opportunities to informally chat to people. The software that emulates this doesn't do a good job: you have to actively move towards someone and interrupt their conversation to get to informally chat with them, there are no spontaneous opportunities such as ending up near someone in the breakfast line at the hotel, happening to use the same elevator, bumping into people at the aitport and taking the same train downtown, etc. Having the PSA fully online will reduce it to a talks and Q&A event without any of the real benefits that actual conferences have. Also, (and I'm sorry to say this) the PSA is a bit elitist and exclusive when it comes to who gets to present: it's the only conference in the (wider) field that expects 5,000-word papers instead of just an abstract and in addition has a comparatively low acceptance rate. Having such a high threshold with respect to who gets to go should come with a lot of benefits for those who get accepted. If the PSA is nothing more than just talks with Q&A, there will be less initiative to bother with writing a 5,000-word paper. (One might as well write a full-length paper and present it elsewhere.)","I have a giant caveat that goes along with this 'agree'. If the PSA is to have some sort of special reason to be in-person, then it should also make sure that it is truly inclusive. Not only continue to have other ways of allowing people to participate (like the in-person poster session, which is great) but also continue to include other ways to bring in people from groups that have been left out of the PSA meetings. I know that the PSA is committed to increasing diversity already but I think that we can (and must) do much more.","The PSA biennial conference, when held in-person, is a great networking event and is especially beneficial for grad students and early career scholars. I don't know if these benefits would be true of a remote version of the conference. Further, I don't know how many talks I would actually attend if it were held remotely (I'm guessing \"fewer\"). Finally, I don't know how much I would get out of each remote talk that I would attend (I'm guessing less than what I get out of each in-person talk). These are all cons. The pros, of course, are the reduction in carbon footprints. I don't know how to weigh the tradeoffs, so I selected \"unsure.\"","I think that a partly in person conference could be a good idea, mostly for the purposes of networking. However, if partially remote is not an option, then I think fully remote is better than fully in person.","The PSA biennial conference is likely the only conference I would attend in person on a regular basis - I plan to reduce my travel mainly w/respect to one-off lectures.","The PSA is one of the few events that allows me to explore so many areas of phil sci that I wouldn't otherwise learn about, while also catching up with so many colleagues working in my area -- the kind of interaction that, so far at least, I haven't seen replicated online. Further, the event can be held in a way that mitigates some of the travel cost, by putting it in a region where many participants will be able to attend by train/etc., and near a major airport so that most attendees won't need to take flights with multiple connections.","At least for me, the PSA would be the conference where I would expect to see a lot of my network in the same place at once. If we were only going to keep a small number of conferences in person, making the PSA one of them would maximize the benefits, from my perspective.","Since PSA meets only every other year and is an opportunity to hear a lot of new research and meeting many people in the field, it should continue to meet in person. Smaller conferences and meetings (10 speakers or less) can adequately achieve their goals without an in-person meeting, and certainly lecture series with one invited speaker should all be virtual.","To offset the problems with online meetings I listed above.","Though see above for my ideas about how PSA should be changed to facilitate / increase the amount of 'requires in-person' interactions","I never managed to participate in a psa meeting due to financial difficulties yet i do believe personal informal interactions are important. Certainly not every talk should be face to face but a meeting of one every two years is certainly important for those who could afford it.","I acknowledge that there will be tradeoffs, but I think we are at the point where we ought to do everything in our power to reduce our carbon footprints.","I wonder if PSA could be in person every four years and online every two years? It seems important that graduate students have a chance to do an in-person conference at least once during graduate school.","In-person conference is a magical thing. There is an (impossible to assess, I think) opportunity cost to moving it online, which I recognize is a case of trading tangible good (reducing carbon emission) for intangible, impossible to assess, possibly non-existing chance of extra magic. Personally, I decided to pursue philosophy because of my experience at an in-person meeting, and probably would not have pursued philosophy if I didn't have that. But that might be an anomaly and there might be people for whom the reverse is true.","I think there is a special reason to keep it in person because in my experience the PSA has been the main place for me (and others I know) as an early career scholar to meet people from around the world in the community. This is incredibly essential for building relationships that will last throughout my career. The scale and prestige of the conference makes it a natural place for scholars in the community to meet and socialize.","The field will die without a regular in-person meeting.","I believe that it should have both in-person and a remote activities. The remote activities should be just as selective in terms of quality and sufficiently rich that they would provide a great experience for people who can do only that.","This is a special meeting because it is the only main one for our discipline.  I think we should make virtual talks easy and common, though.","The PSA is unique in bringing the phil sci community together and vital for net-working and personal relations. Those just don't happen over zoom meeting. I participated in the PSA online poster meeting and that worked well I thought. If it was just about the academic content, I do think even the PSA conference could be conducted online. The massive scale of the talks will be a problem, if one would want to sit through the entire program. Then again, it is an issue also for the physical meeting! So ultimately it really comes down to whether one would want to sacrifice the social aspect. I personally would find it sad to do so entirely, but I'm definitely supportive of having more online meetings also in the future. For me personally, the problem of being away from my family (small kids) would be an even more important consideration than climate change. At least for the nearer future. So I probably would attend the online PSA version in the coming years if that was an option, but for admittedly more egoistic reasons.  ","the psa meeting is the raison d'etre of the society. This is what unifies it. it creates a sense of community that simply cannot be emulated online.","Favorite conference, super valuable, much would be lost if moved fully online.","As above. Also, the PSA's biennial nature is superior in this regard to many other conferences. Perhaps conferences could adopt an on-line version in alternating years.","I enjoy and benefit from some contacts that I take home from PSA and similar conferences. However, even as a tenured professor at research-emphasizing US university, I do not have an annual travel budget large enough to cover expenses for even one remote conference, much less two (as, for example, ISHPSSB normally happens the same fiscal year as PSA). Given that PSA normally also happens mid-semester, I find that attending PSA is sometimes hard to justify. Were there any other way to establish professional contacts and hear more sessions, it would be even harder to justify.","Personal engagement still seems to be an important modality for human interaction and career development. I fear for the younger generation of scholars, if in-person (or at least hybrid) meetings were cease without being sure that the alternative was viable. As somebody in a small institution (where I was the sole philosopher and one of only a small number of philosophers of science within the immediate geographical region), being able to connect with people at the PSA was very important to my early career. Once I became more established and settled in my career, foregoing meetings became more of an option for me, although I will admit that it has meant that I feel less in-touch with new developments being pursued by the younger, 'frontier scholars' of the field.","I'm inclined to disagree. But because the conference is biennial instead of annual, perhaps that would be a reason for me to answer more cautiously.","As I said in response to a question above: 'There's a whole range of stuff that isn't just captured under 'fostering existing relationships' and 'initiating new relationships'. There's a level of feedback on one's work, productive discussion about others' work, and generally productive philosophical discussion which is simply impossible (in my experience) with online events. I'm thinking, for example, of the chats that spontaneously linger after Q&A is over, and continue over a drink or a meal, and the random encounters in the halls in between sessions, and so forth. Those are immensely valuable (socially and professionally) and impossible to replicate online. This past year+ has made me realize how much those interactions—even more so than the talks and Q&A—are the real substance of the benefit I get from conferences.' I think the PSA is an exceptionally valuable and important forum, in our discipline, for these sorts of interactions. It would be a huge loss to get rid of that.","Community is essential for doing philosophy well, and community-building is best done in person.  I don't think even the best technology can change the fact that we are social organisms who relate as social organisms.  PSA is the premier conference for philosophy of science... or at least it used to be.  To continue to function as a community we need to meet face to face from time to time.","There's a huge value-added by being physically in person with other like-minded scholars, for the longer chats in the hallways, at meals, over coffee and beer, &c. I could let APAs go and pick and choose my spots with online conferences, but I *really* want to keep going with in-person PSA meetings.","I find it hard to judge how such a relatively large event would work online. Of course the environmental gains are especially big. And interaction works best in small groups. However, the PSA conference is special","The PSA biennial conference is sufficiently general that the interactions it generates---between individuals would likely not seek out interaction on an online forum---are beneficial to the discipline as a whole. Additionally, it is only held once every 2 years. I would certainly advocate against moving to an annual conference, and would even advocate for the various APA conferences to become biennial events.  Even if we granted that an in-person PSA every other year was too much of a carbon footprint, I would argue that a PSA every 3 years is a better solution than moving them online.","I take it that PSA has a contract with the hotel, so it will be financially liable.","I don't have the data to evaluate the antecedent and have a hard time thinking about the consequent without the data. I don't think the PSA is more 'special' (i.e. privileged) relative to other conferences.","I really do believe this. The PSA is a wonderful conference, and has made me feel part of a community in a way that most other conferences, both big and small, that I've been to simply have not.  There's something really edifying and inclusive about it -- and it's only every couple of years after all. ","As noted above, I believe strongly that the benefits of in-person conferences are numerous and simply cannot be replicated in online formats.","Again, I think it's important that it's the largest conference for philosophy of science. I think there are also things about the online experience that don't make sense for a large conference. It's the best time to see people from a wide variety of places and to have those informal interactions that make conferences fun. It's nice to go somewhere once every other year. The poster session is a very hard thing to translate online.","On the one hand, I strongly believe that we should do our best to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. On the other, I feel that the in-person PSA conferences are very important opportunity for networking, which are hard to replace with virtual conferences without impairing their functions to facilitate networking.","The social interactions that are possible are not completely compensated for by the remote interactions.  Informal conversations and personal relationship remain an integral part of intellectual life.","On line communication is a hollow substitute for real embodied human communication. It's fine for limited, temporary purposes but it is dehumanizing as a replacement for genuine human interaction, which both scientific and philosophical communication requires.","My sense is that PSA because it happens only every other year and has an international draw, the in-person meeting is justifiable.","Many, but not all, conferences ought to retain the social component—and the biennial conference especially","I honestly think that despite the drawbacks of a fully in-person conference, until we figure out how to have better online conferences--and we are very far--95% of every PSA should be in person.  This is based on the assumption that we can address the impact of international or even domestic travel using offsets.  If offsets are not enough or not appropriate, then I am not sure what to do.  Maybe PSA and EPSA should coordinate times and have some periods that are joint and online, but that the rest of each conference is in person.  We could do this with societies on other continents as well.","What's special about PSA? Infrequency doesn't in itself make for a good argument.","I see no reason that the talks must be in person and there are some advantages to virtual talks. The ability to record talks is a large benefit. I think the PSA biennial meeting serves a lot of professional functions via the components of the program other than the talks. I suspect that many of these functions can be accomplished virtually, but it will require some thinking about how to do this well. More than that, I think it will require a commitment from all of us to treat online conferences like we treat in-person conferences rather than popping in for a few talks and turning our video off.","I'm more inclined to agree than disagree, for reasons that I can only sketch here. If we think that research in the philosophy of science is worthwhile, then we must think that to some extent it is worth expending resources on it that have alternative valuable uses. Those resources include the generation of some amount of CO2 (not only by traveling). I think that in-person conferences provide not only a forum for the scheduled exchange of ideas (which can be accomplished online) but also unplanned and unplannable opportunities for making new contacts and exchanging ideas. It is therefore possible in principle, and not implausible in practice, that the benefits of in-person conferences (in terms of promoting worthwhile research in the philosophy of science) exceed the costs (including in terms of carbon emissions). Carbon emissions have instrumental benefits (as well, of course, as costs), and the benefits need to be considered as well as the costs: they make good things possible that cannot be obtained without incurring other costs that also matter. I take it that we do not have reliable empirical estimates of the magnitudes of the costs and benefits in this particular case (in-person conferences). What I am resisting is the apriorism involved in assuming that the costs must exceed the benefits; there is no 'must' about it.","PSA meetings only happen every two years and bring together a diversity of researchers unlike any other conference. Virtual conference participation cannot replicate the in person conference. I would be much less likely to attend.","The PSA is, for me, one of the top three hubs for my intellectual life in a way that, e.g., the APA isn't. I think it's because of the size -- it's big enough to have most of the people I engage with in philosophy of science present, but small enough that there aren't a ton of people from other specialties I don't know. Of all the conferences I attend, it would be the last, or maybe one of the two last, opportunities to see my community that I would want to lose.","It is a major conference that only takes place every other year.","But I don't agree that more workshops should take place remotely.","I believe there must be a focus for in person meetings due to the importance of contingent interaction (informal meetings and the unexpected things that happen when present at conferences) that cannot be easily duplicated online and to promote a sense of community. But we should also work on novel online approaches to facilitate ways to enhance the remote participant experience.","If I'm honest, I'm not interested in fully virtual conferences. I've stopped agreeing to speak at them, and hardly attend them. If I so I am usually distracted. I've had a very hard time duplicating a virtual conference the networking opportunities, friend-building experiences, and emotional excitement that come with in person conferences. The PSA is the most important conference I attend; I do not think I would be as diverse and interesting of a scholar had I not (somewhat randomly) entered into certain conversations at the PSA meeting. I doubt these conversations would ever have taken place if the conference were online only. I think there should be an environmental review of what we can do better. I am willing to purchase offsets for my travel, to sponsor a graduate student's 'green' travel, to reduce food waste at the conference, to hold the conference someplace other than a boring hotel and conference center. I hope that the impact of such programs is investigated before the biannual conference is moved fully online. ","The PSA is the most important conference and the benefits of physical attendance are especially high due to the presence of so many great friends and colleagues.","Only when,if early career researchers benefit from in-person activities might enable them to build technical and non-technical capabilities by engaging with leaders in the specific discipline.","The large scale social aspect of PSA is still important and cannot easily be replicated online.  We need fewer, better in-person meetings in the profession.  PSA is likely going to be one of those fewer, better meetings.","I absolutely think virtual participation should be permitted as a basic precondition of future in-person conferences. But there are special reasons for big meetings, especially biennial ones, to have an in-person component.","I'm unsure how significant a consideration this is. However, although geographical isolation makes it more difficult to attend the PSA and other large conferences, and although attendance involves air travel, these conferences often represent the only opportunity for those of us in the southern hemisphere to meet colleagues and make new connections in person. And if conferences have online options, our institutions will almost certainly cancel such travel entirely. Perhaps that is ultimately a good thing, but it is very hard to be a part of the international community as things already are.","The PSA is such a big conference that the advantages of an in-person conference are less pronounced than in the case of smaller conferences or workshops. Thus, if anything I think there is a special reason to hold the PSA online or in a hybrid form, even though I believe that other conferences and workshops would loose more by making this move.","In-person events are perhaps the only opportunities for junior scholars (especially those from less-than-stellar academic backgrounds) to get to know other scholars.","Online is simply inferior.","For most people, there is some conference that is their 'home' in the discipline, where they can go, and expect to see a good proportion of their friends and colleagues that they interact with in writing and online. The PSA serves that role for many people.","Any in-person conference should include a required mechanism by which all of the carbon produced by the conference and each of the participants is verifiably offset 110% by any number of reduction/offset strategies. This will create a higher cost conference, but the higher cost will be and investment rather than an expense.","I think we should promote a robust hybrid model with a recommendation/ restriction on time-flights for example.","I don't think there is any special reason for PSA or the discipline that requires the biennial conference to be held in person. I think (and hope) that we will have a lot of opportunities for (safe) in-person contact at our home institutions or with shorter-distance in-person events.","The PSA is the my only opportunity to meet with my North-American friends and colleagues. It would be a great loss not to have this any more. And one transatlantic flight every other year is not bringing about the world's end (in particular given that I am buying offsets for it).","I have a hard time imagining how much the lack of social interactions will impact the overall experience/use of the conference. On the other hand, as it is I have no money to travel so I could not attend at all if it were not online.","Hybrid meeting would be best. It is important especially to younger scholars to socialize. I personally don't like to travel that much anymore. More importantly, the hybrid mode would allow more papers, more participants, and less financial constraints. There is so much gate-keeping taking place due to the in-person format that restricts the number of papers to be presented. I've been myself in the PSA programme committee, and I have to say that apart from some very clear cases it was really difficult to decide what papers to accept and what to reject. There few if any outstanding papers, a few not acceptable ones, and the majority of the papers were well-written, and OK.","Remote conferences, at present, diminish the attention and importance of contributions. Attendance is less appealing. This hurts the field. There is no back and forth questioning, and no opportunity for detailed communications outside of a session. Most of the attention goes to worrying about technical glitches. We don't meet new scholars.","There are benefits to serendipitous interaction in an environment away from home.","I think as a flagship conference for philosophy of science, the PSA meeting has an important professional function for the field. But I do think that if participants have to take long-distance flights to join PSA, the should commit to not taking other long-distance flights that year.","The PSA meetings play an important role in fostering community among philosophers of science. I am introvert and a bit socially awkward, and I have never felt very comfortable or welcome at APA meetings. Over the years I have come to feel that PSA is a kind of academic home. That function can not be filled online.","In-person (social) interaction is an important benefit of PSA meetings.","The benefit gained from social interaction outside the talks is not possible with an exclusively online format.","Perhaps it does not need to be biennial. Once every three years would probably suffice.","Philosophical research can be lonely, but these conferences create a sense of community. Especially so the PSA, where philosophers of science make an effort to gather, and sometimes come even if they're not presenting. I would go as far as stating that the social/informal aspect of it is more important than the mere exchange of information or philosophical views. It's also important for the discipline to create a sense of community: one i more likely to be more charitable and fair to the papers of an author one has met in the flesh.","I think we would lose what makes the PSA and other conferences special by hosting them online. In my opinion, the value in such meetings lies primarily in the kinds of informal interactions that they facilitate, for which the formal parts serve as jumping-off points. I also think there is so much more to gain by being in a room with people than being at home over zoom. My experience giving and attending zoom talks has left me feeling empty. Fostering and building community is best done in person.","Unlike more specialized conferences, where a lot of the participants are already familiar with each other’s research, the breadth of PSA permits participants to learn about research they were not familiar with before or meet researchers they otherwise would not have an opportunity to meet.","social part, and meeting colleagues."]},{id:"onlineActivities",question:"Other Online Activities",responses:["Gave talks to a variety of groups.","Remote lab meetings","I organised an online seminar series and a workshop series too.","I participated in academic meetings of every description online.","We do not have a PhD program, but we do advise MA student capstones.

An option to gather a group and break out to a different ‘room’ and talk.","The gap is much too large.","Difficult question. I think there may simply be inherent trade offs.","Virtual social networking time can be created--but perhaps they can be improved by having specific 'break-out' rooms arranged around themes of research interest/topic so as to increase the likelihood of sparking potential collaborations","more warm-up activities","In my view, they have been maxxed out. The benefits of in-person meetings are already almost entirely outside of the actual talk-delivery. There is no functional way, after a year of trying, to get these benefits in a virtual format. They are just different formats, neither replaces the other.","I think, sadly, that there is no feasible way to remedy the social shortfalls, at least not significantly.",'I take it that the main challenge is loosing in "Initiating new collegial relationships". I think that creating official time for continuing the conversation after Q&A is crucial. E.g., I just right now gave a talk, and would have loved keep talking to some people from the Q&A. But since it is online, one ends up putting other things in the calendar. So, keeping the standard Q&A session but allowing for then informal conversation after the session (perhaps creation rooms in zoom, one per talk given in the session; or allowing people to ask to be put in rooms [or have a shared space where they can agree to go an talk.])',"Including chat sessions in the coffee break.","For a Pittsburgh Center conference, after the formal presentations, we were invited to gather.town for a virtual reception. I thought this worked well, except all the icons from which to choose looked like grammar school kids. I think such software should be explored to create more informal aspects at virtual meetings.","It is better if talks are short in online meetings, and there is time for discussion. Breakout groups are good.","The smaller and more continuous and familiar the group, the higher-quality the work. That has costs, too. The arrangement that works best seems to be like a research group--which is less accessible to those of us at non-PhD granting universities. It's also very different from a typical conference! One of the things that's wonderful about PSA is staying in touch with what's going on outside my immediate research area.",'Keep groups small enough, with rotating breakout discussion groups as needed, so that everybody can "see" everybody else. Reduce the amount of time when a shared slide takes up the whole screen. Facilitate discussion with a purpose.',"Events that are entirely virtual will never provide the benefits of in-person meetings, simply because an essential aspect of real-life meetings is being able to informally talk to people when you happen to bump into them, being able to engage with your audience in a talk (pick up facial expressions, seeing them laugh when a quip went well, seeing them get unfocused if they're bored which signals me to speed up this part of the talk, etc.), being able to engage with a speaker when sitting in the audience, etc. What would work better is hybrid events, such that at least there is a choice. I wouldn't mind if part of the events that I attend were online (so you can just attend even if it's hard to travel), but I need a good part to be in person to compensate for life online. If everything were to be online in the future, as it has been for more than a year now, That would have extremely dire consequences for the field. But going hybrid at least some of the time might work.","Finding ways to foster new collegial relationships in ways that don't perpetuate the cliques and in-groups that already exist. Taking action to ensure inclusivity and well-being for all participants. This is not just an ideal we pay lip service to, but something that we need to actively work on. Planning smaller group discussion formats (e.g. @4-5 people) that allow real engagement is necessary. Large group discussions do not foster engagement but simply platform one or two people who often dominate conversations.",'I think that having optional social hours for participants of conferences is a good idea, currently implemented by some conferences but not all. I also think that people need to consider "zoom fatigue" might be worse than regular conference fatigue - and therefore not schedule events that require a lot of zoom time at once without a break. Spreading conferences out over multiple days, even nonconsecutive days, has worked really well at some conferences, in my opinion (without needing to travel, this becomes a possibility that we didn\'t have before). I also think that there is no great solution to the problem of time differences between different places in the world for online talks, but this needs to be something that conference planners take into consideration regularly. A special challenge for online conferences is the fact that people at home aren\'t able to "pause" their other personal/work responsibilities as easily for a conference they\'re attending from home, like they would for an in person conference; I think this requires a culture shift around what it means to attend a conference or other event, and the understanding that people might be only participating some of the time or may need to multitask with their other responsibilities.',"Depending on what kinds of platforms are now available, some type of informal discussion format would be especially valuable. I think the PSA 'interest lunches' could work well online - perhaps expand those?","I don't know how/if it is possible, but some way to recreate casual interactions. Several conferences I attended tried to create spaces for that, but each was (unfortunately) a complete failure. Relatedly, it was very hard for me to manage family/care obligations while working from home - because my kids (reasonably) didn't understand my requests for uninterrupted time on (for example) a Saturday afternoon.","Keep one or two individuals from dominating discussion. (A problem for in-person meetings too.)","I cannot think of anything. I think there are some aspects of the in person conference that cannot be replicated online.","Create opportunities for informal conversations following a talk.","The hardest part is to replace the time spent building community and relationships via informal gatherings. Finding out how to provide a decent surrogate would be wonderful.","Short of ensuring that everyone lives in the same timezone, has good health and has access to reliable hardware, software and broadband, it's hard to say.  I certainly am very worried about narratives that depict online meetings are more inclusive than in-person meetings. Both types of meetings have advantages, and include different types of people.","This might sound strange, but I think that the best thing is to stop trying to have virtual events 'replicate' in-person meetings. Instead, I would suggest that we try to identify when virtual events succeed (focus on information transmission, clear questions & decisions, more transactional engagements), and thereby free up space for in-person events to focus on interactions where subtlety, nuance, human connection, etc. are critical. For example, could a conference have the talks occur virtually 1-2 weeks prior to a (shorter-than-usual) in-person event that primarily focuses on group discussions? (Another issue (in my experience) is that people usually don't block off their calendars for virtual events in the same way that they do when they travel for something in-person. But improving that dimension (so that people are fully engaged in the virtual event) would require a sociological change within the academic community.)","More reliable technology.","Longer discussion times and they should not be recorded","Some conferences/workshop have been offering a Slack or Discord chat room for participants which, while not a perfect substitute, is a start in thinking about how to recreate the social aspects of events.","Better chairing practices; clearer speaking guidelines. I find that domination of discussion is a bigger issue online because there are fewer social cues for someone to realize that they should stop talking or for other people to express that they do not approve of what's going on. Active chairing helps a lot. I've found that 'official talks' are often actively chaired in a helpful way, but unofficial chats, such as individual breakout rooms during the PSA poster session, are often not, and consequently are more prone to domination problems.","I think more social time would be best, but I want to stress that I think with the current technology it would be pretty much impossible to get even a reasonable fraction of the benefits of the social time of in-person meetings. I think in-person meetings are important for the health and productivity of the research community.","It really helped to have chat rooms where we could meet and interact. This was not the same as attending in person, but real work got done and people who could not attend in person under even the best of circumstances (i.e. folks with mobility disabilities) were able to participate fully.","We need some better solution to socializing.  Chatting on zoom is awkward.  There is no beer.  I think what we really need is what I see my kids having online with friends - worlds with avatars where we can interact with things in the world.","very little - they have their own strengths, but are also severely deficient. They are brittle, they are extremely tiring, they fail to foster any sense of community, they elicit a weaker engagement than in person activities, they are far from being neutral for the environment (electricity and data storage are far from green). they can complement but can't replace in person activities, and I hope the PSA will not replace its in person meetings with them.","Strategically structure them in different ways, with fewer long-form talks","I would be more than happy to brainstorm this with a diverse group of people. I hosted such a conference, and we did our best to try and replicate these benefits. The only thing that occurred to us is that a hybrid option might be interesting - not one where some people Zoom and others and in person, rather an event that has some fully online sessions would certainly be an interesting option.","Figuring out a way to have hybrid events with both in-person and on-line participation could be revolutionary. However, figuring how to not have the 'in-person' participants monopolize the Q&A and discussion would be important.","I was impressed with how the PSA virtual poster session went this past January. The breakout rooms were particularly well done, as participants could hop around from session to session and the small group (≤4) discussions were optimal.","Make sure to include tools that facilitate mingling (e.g. wonder, gather or similar platforms)","Having a list of the other participants ahead of time. Social/mingling times at the beginning / end of sessions, with ability to step into breakout rooms. Some facilitated networking / discussion periods to get folks mixing it up.","Reconsider length of events, perhaps make pre-recording a norm. It's hard to focus for so long online. Shorter slots?","Some method for encouraging interaction between individuals who are not already inclined to interact. I realize this is difficult, since many methods to do this can feel artificial and awkward.","I suppose that the technology will keep improving.","I guess change the culture so it's acceptable to say that you won't attend a faculty meeting or teach a class because you're at a virtual conference. I just felt like that was not an option for me at present.","More opportunities to socialize, more natural ways to talk `off the record'","substantial shifts in cultural norms and acknowledgment of what actually goes into doing online meetings effectively.","Good question.  I haven't had a chance to try out any of the versions of the 'cocktail hour' software that are on the market now, but in principle I don't see why these couldn't be used to sort of simulate the sorts of opening volleys, socially speaking, that I usually make at in-person events: namely, by telling someone that I enjoyed their paper and thought 'blah' about it.  Honestly I don't see why a professional relationship can't be fostered that way. Things would be different if I were looking for friends or dating -- and I don't mean that to sound facetious, lots of people make really significant personal and romantic relationships at conferences! But I'm not; I am however looking for people to have big philosophical discussions with, and I can have them online just fine. I suppose that something that needs addressed is a way for people to talk 'off the record'. Other than the Zoom chat function, I don't see an obvious good way for people to easily have conversations of a more private nature (which can be important for all sorts of reasons). ","I'm skeptical that much more can be done with current technology. And I think that the cons of virtual meetings far outweigh the pros with the current state of things.","My view is that this is hopeless. I love academic conferences. I've given something like 150 talks in the last ten years. I won't do this online.","Good discussion moderators are key. Maybe each talk can have a formal recorded Q&A, and then after each session there can be a more informal discussion that's not recorded.","What was most obviously lacking in virtual interactions was, in my view, the more informal and social aspects. These times can be particularly important, for example in fostering and cultivating professional relationships. It seems difficult to organize informal and social events virtually, but I hope that it can somehow be achieved!","Some form of remote socializing, which is for substituting coffee breaks and receptions in in-person meetings. I don't know whether this is possible, but I think it would be a great improvement if we could have a better socializing function.","More recording.  Time differences are often a problem. Distribution of materials ahead of time (particularly for workshops)","On line work will NEVER be adequate to replace face-to-face human contact which is crucual for scientific and philosophical communication.","After a year of trying to find ways to bring my home department together socially, and non-awkwardly, I have to say that I have little hope for substantially improving the social aspect of online conferences.","Get the tech sorted out so use is transparent and obvious.  Regulate who talks most (a problem not unique to on-line interactions.)","I am not sure, but we need to change our use of the technology and develop new norms if we want to try to duplicate some of the benefits of an in-person conference.  Thi Nguyen had a great Facebook post and then blog post (which I can't find at the moment) on some of the things done at an aesthetics conference that seemed to work very well.  Whatever we do, we should be aware that in-person human communication is a high-bandwidth interaction, involving dimensions that we might not be conscious of.  I don't think that with current technology we can ever get that back, completely, in an online conference, but we can make them better than they are now.","I think applications like Gather are not bad for more organic mingling and discussion. I think that people also need to commit themselves to being present and fully participating in virtual conferences. It is so easy to attend one or two talks at a virtual conference and to keep your video off and then go about the rest of your day. I think it is possible to recreate much of the in-person components, but to do that people need to be committed to blocking off their day and attending social components of a conference and scheduling meetings with other participants. Maybe a conference could help facilitate and encourage meetings by having a directory of participants with emails as well as designated time in the conference program for one-one-one meetings. Maybe it could even help schedule these meetings using some scheduling platform.","I am retired.","Place ACS and AIP journals on line FREE!","People need to learn to engage actively in online events. In my experience this can be done. Some simple operational rules go a long way, e.g., everyone wearing headphones and unmuting so that the whole room can hear the whole room. I have also found it essential to create pre- and post-meeting opportunities for informal conversations. Abrupt beginnings and endings of online meetings are really contrary to social engagement and community0building.","Create space for explicitly informal exchange (in addition to the more formal topical discussions)","No idea. Not a fan.","As technology improves maybe we'll have ways to have something that feels more like casual conversations in hallways during coffee breaks or at meals. Right now I just don't think we're there and I've found attempts at this pretty awkward (especially with those I don't already know)","I am somewhat of a fan of prerecorded talks - with only the Q&A being live. Also, I think people should stop presenting with slides (or keep them to an ABSOLUTE minimum), so that the audience can actually see them talking, and not just stare at a screen with slides and with just some voice commenting on them.","Some conferences happened where only the speaker can be seen, but not the participants. This needs to be changed. It would be useful to create an area, before or during breaktime of lecture, where everybody can see everybody and can interact. Sometimes I have noticed participants can do texting but cannot see.","Nothing","- To be clear, I don't think virtual academic events can capture the benefits of meeting in person. But here are suggestions: - Building in significant opportunities for one-on-one and small group interactions. - Screening or limiting attendance. - Somehow structure or create formalized modes of networking. ","Careful and Sensitive facilitation of networking opportunities through breakout rooms.","We just need to get used to the virtual academic events, have them more often, and integrate them with in-person meetings.","Better familiarity with platforms for social aspects of events","Working technology is an obvious one, but I think the big part of it is being so familiar with technology that we no longer need to worry about things going wrong, also being able to smoothly address situation when things do go wrong. We could also benefit by outside the box about the format of the exchange, try not so much to replicate physical equivalents as to try go back to square one.","They should be given equal prestige and equal billing at big conferences.

Figuring out how to get that ease and serendipity of contact is one of the most difficult things for online interactions.","In my view, there are distinct benefits to both. But it is not possible to entirely replicate the experience of in-person meetings in virtual media. It is better to clearly identify the strengths and weaknesses of both and work to balance them.","Greater levels of meeting structures, agendas, and details subject outlines provided in advance to the participants. Informal 'studio' time where participants can speak informally and candidly in a tech environment that is provably unrecorded","Once the technological issues are contained, the size of the gathering is a crucial factor.","Spread event over more days with more breaks in between them (for casual catch-ups or making new connections and collaborations); have mini-conferences for specific clusters of topics rather than have only one big conference; official virtual happy hour","Nothing much. They just lost cause as far as social interaction is concerned.","Something that replicates the social function of in person social meetings. Right now it seems pretty impossible to me but maybe it can be done with some trial and error. Maybe some separate social hours. For a grad student online and offline initiating contact comes with different types of anxiety. I chat easily with new people in person after a talk and at bars/dinner for example but zoom seems to be all 'official' in some way and there is no reason or opportunity to randomly initiate a chat with someone.","I think that perhaps some casual on-screen time for smaller groups would be useful for capturing *some* of the benefits of in-person conferences.  I think also that extended Q&A may be good since the back and forth can take a bit longer in the virtual format.","With conferences, there's a serious need to do much better with technical problems. Even large, important conferences with attendees charged high prices, there were frequent glitches. Find a way for open, and back and forth questions with follow-up, not transmitted anonymously by the organizer.","use technology that simulates personal and social interactions (like Spatialchat)","I would combine them with in-person occasions. Maybe one meeting could be planned to happen in two different locations at same time, permitting participants to choose where to be present (maybe the nearest home place). Or two different meetings could agree to combine and to organize one if them online/remote and one in-person.","One feature I appreciated at The Science of Consciousness 2020, held virtually last September by the University of Arizona, was a system which all conference attendees logged into to watch talks, and which included an instant-messaging application. I found a lot of people sent messages using this service, and I had a number of productive conversations through it. Using this service felt less formal and easier than looking up someone's email and reaching out to them that way. Also, it being a conference-only ap created a sense that you were somehow in the room over drinks and this was your chance to connect. Beyond this, I think adding more opportunities to log in early, or hang around after, a talk or event, in order to informally socialize over Zoom in smaller breakout rooms could simulate those short post-talk hallway conversations we all miss.","better tech infrastructure, hiring more academics -since the surplus of questions pending is gargantuan","Not sure","There's no substitute for networking opportunities afforded by in-person events. Online presenters should work with organizers in advance to assure that everyone is comfortable with basic Zoom functionality and that mic levels are good.","I'm not sure. I've been in contexts where they try to do small group breakouts for social purposes, but it is always very awkward. I'm just not sure we have the technology, yet, to allow these events to have the social aspects of live events. That's OK, we just need to find other ways to get those needs met. Honestly, I find that my collegial relationships have improved with anyone who enjoys email as a medium. I've taken up several regular communication flows via email, including one with a new colleague, and they have been quite valuable. More valuable than any breakout session in Zoom.","In my view, virtual academic events will never produce the benefits of in-person meetings.

The possibility of pausing normal life, setting aside other responsibilities, and focusing on a problem together was eliminated.","Some events allowed extra time for individuals to talk after an event and that was really great.  Others shut off events when the time was up which didn't allow that.","extreme tiredness and boredom with unending zoom sessions for people who spend part of their week on zoom.","Depth of engagement with talks","I think the loss of immersion that occurs at conferences is definitely a loss. All that thinking and socializing around matters of common interest is a big deal. Additionally, a non-home location also relieves some other demands (cleaning, household projects, care obligations, etc.) - while I recognize there is privilege associated with removing some of those demands, it is still nice where possible.","Lots of melt -- registered participants who didn't show up. I was even one of those people on occasion. A pandemic makes this kind of thing hard to fit in.","There's a whole range of stuff that isn't just captured under 'fostering existing relationships' and 'initiating new relationships'. There's a level of feedback on one's work, productive discussion about others' work, and general professional benefit which is simply impossible (in my experience) with online events. The chats that linger after Q&A is over and continue over a drink or a meal, the random encounters in the halls in between sessions, etc. Those are immensely valuable (socially and professionally) and impossible to replicate online. This past year+ has made me realize how much those interactions—even more so than the talks and Q&A—are the real substance of the benefit I get from conferences.","Zoom fatigue","Serendipitous informal discussions (outside of formal Q&A), networking, discussing issues in the profession, meeting and learning more about what early career scholars are working on.","General 'Zoom fatigue', not feeling motivated to attend.","Ability to set aside distractions/make time to fully attend and participate in conferences, etc. Like, when you travel to a conference, your schedule is automatically devoted to the conference. You don't have faculty meetings that intersperse with conference sessions. This was probably the hardest part, although missing out on good in-the-moment Q&A exchanges and social time was the saddest part.","More time and energy in terms of organization of events and online environment.","General screen fatigue.","Small discussions with engaged participants (twenty or fewer) tended to go very smoothly. Larger discussions or Q&A sessions were much harder. It's better when everyone can see everyone else (or at least everyone who's camera is on) on a single screen, both as a discussant and as a speaker. It's especially hard as a speaker just to talk into the void. Skilled mediation for large discussions is essential. If the discussion or Q&A session is recorded, it can sometimes suppress discussion (people don't want to look like they're confused or toss out a wild idea if it's being recorded for posterity, especially younger scholars or students).","Illicit recording of online talks is a significant concern. At a neighboring institution (Boise State), a recording made by a student led to immediate cancellation of 52 class sections focused on diversity and social justice.","Basic human communication, which a virtual environment is NOT.","From speaker perspective, inability to gauge audience engagement and comprehension while giving the talk.","(1) People turned off cameras so that the lecture was to a series of rectangles.  (2) It's not just about friendship and collegial relationships.  At an in-person conference, there is an enormous amount of learning and cross-fertilization of many types that occurs in the halls, near the conference, at meals, over drinks, etc.  (3) In an in-person conference, there is, sometimes, an enthusiasm and excitement in the Q&A that's difficult to have on Zoom.

What a shame!","I was the organizer for a one-day local conference in Spring '20 that is an annual event. We cut the length of the meeting half because the idea of sitting at a computer screen for an entire day was intolerable! The same is being done for the Spring '21 version.

But this question is vague: the PSa is not 'many conferences'. It is sui generis in this field. It should continue to be hosted in person, biennially. Other things like the Causality in the Sciences series could become more virtually-oriented, perhaps meeting every other year in person then virtually.","I think it is necessary to carefully balance the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions with the need for meaningful face-to-face interactions during professional meetings. I strongly support that we do not return to the ever busier conference circuit of the last few decades. The most active of us basically spent the summer months jet-setting around the globe. But I think some key conferences, especially the PSA meeting definitely should remain fully in person conferences. (this also explains my 'no' for the next question: I think virtual should be the default for many meetings, but not for the PSA biannual conference. For conferences that are held in person (which will hopefully include the PSA meeting) it would be great to have some means of fully offsetting all airtravel, and do that with one of the organizations, where chances are high that what one buys are genuine offsets (such as atmosfair from Germany). Here it would be great, if somehow PSA funds could be used (and generated) for this, since many members will have problems with having offsets be reimbursed by their home institutions. I realize, of course, that offsets are no panacea and should only be used as an instrument for those conferences that are deemed too important to be moved online.",'This has an implicit assumption that travel is the "bad guy" in producing carbon emissions. But buying lots of computers and using electricity all the time with upgraded internet has costs as well. Not as much, but it\'s important not to fixate on one factor. Hybrid approaches can work, though it takes more effort on the part of organizers .',"Hosting conferences online will severely harm both the field and many individuals (i.e., those with bad tech or those who watch talks but simply aren't that quick with getting into a one-on-one chat with someone else when tech is involved).","I think that there should be a combination of online and in-person. Even if it is once every 4 years, having an opportunity to meet people in person is important especially for those who do not go to many conferences, for people coming from universities that are not R1s, and from junior scholars.","Prefer in-person, but Ok to have other online events too, of course.","I think that we should drastically reduce the number of 'general' conferences, and have perhaps one big conference per year plus some topic-specific small workshops.  The PSA should work with other societies in the field to ensure this. I also think that events should be offered in a hybrid mode so that those who can/wish to attend online are able to do so. I do not think that hosting meetings for people who live far away online is an obvious solution, given the problem of time zones! Last but not least: the environmental costs of hosting meetings online (servers, cloud services, data streaming) should also be taken into account. Whether or not these meetings are environmentally friendly depends on cloud host and streaming services used. ","Some kinds of conferences/workshops (in particular, those that are primarily about talks and information transmission) should probably stay online. Other kinds (that put real effort into enabling conversations, discussions, and interactions that are not easy to have online) still have a place. The challenge (in my view) is that most conferences/workshops have historically included a mix of these two, which is why we are all struggling about what to do next. My preference would be to see conferences/workshops intentionally commit to one or the other model (or have two separate components, as I suggested earlier), rather than continuing to try to do both.","Strategic selection of some to be online, others in person.","Figuring out how to do hybrid events seems like the best solution to me. For example, a PSA event located in a major US/Canadian city might be able to attract a good number of local persons with a minimal carbon footprint (and people sometimes can combine the conference with other travel that might have happened anyway (such as visiting relatives in/near the host city). We could also alternate (b/w different formats in different years).","Short answer: yes. Longer answer: hybrid attendance options where online attendees are not second-class citizens at the conference. (Local audiences can enliven talks, and some people combine conference travel with other research functions)","Some, perhaps not 'many.' I am not sure what 'many' means.","It seems prudent for some events---colloquia, highly specialized conferences, to remain online.  However, workshops (especially local workshops) often require a great deal of casual and fluid interaction which is better suited for in-person.  Larger, general conferences (like the PSA, or APA) which encourage mingling across subfields also benefit from in-person location and are harmed by the online framework.","I haven't seen any data on the actual carbon footprint of conferences. Even as someone who wants to see the PSA on the leading edge of climate stewardship, I have a hard time believing that our conference is a gigantic contributor.","I think some conferences should remain online or have an online component (both to reduce travel related CO2 emissions and to allow scholars to participate who might not otherwise be able to). But I do think that there is an important role for some in-person conferences, and I believe the PSA is one such conference. I'm not sure where the right balance between 'some' and 'many' lies though. I usually only attend 1-3 in-person conferences per year, which I suspect is a low number. If anything I'd like to participate in more conferences, workshops, and reading groups than in the past, and making some events virtual or including a virtual component would allow for this. But I think I'm more interested in adding more virtual events on top of 1-3 in-person events per year rather than reducing the number of in-person events further.","Well, sometimes. I think smaller workshops benefit from being online, but I would greatly miss it if the largest conference for philosophy of science (for example!) moved online.","Workshops might be appropriate online; conferences are not","Not sure I would say 'many', but I think there will be a place for some online conferences.  However, I foresee a risk of an already crowded conference calendar becoming even more crowded. A suggestion might be for annual conferences to move into an alternating pattern of online and physical meetings (this would also reduce carbon footprint by ~50%), although the problem of coordinating across multiple time zones makes this difficult for conferences with an international draw.","Some, not all","I am retired.","Yes, save the planet.","Moving solely online will likely discriminate against those who have family obligations at home that cannot be simultaneously juggled while physically at home, or who otherwise have difficulties in visual, auditory, or mental attention processing due to various disabilities in fully connecting and participating online.  I support hybrid options, but not moving solely online.","Up to the organizers.","I think SOME should be.","In general, yes, but I think also that there should be fewer conferences in general.","I think a hybrid version would be best. I have no doubt that in-person conferences are immeasurably better than online conferences: new ideas and collaborations originate in coffee breaks and when having lunch or dinner together, i.e. on the fringes of the actual conference programme. However, being able to show up online is better than not showing up at all.","I reject this framing of the issue. There are other reasons to value online meetings.","Some but not a great majority, we lose an enormous amount of scholarship being limited to on-line conferences. I won't hold one if it must be entirely on-line.","I think that the overall number of academic events (online and in-person) should be reduced and regionalized.

In the Before Times, organizations had done pretty well in not scheduling overlapping conferences, e.g., ISHPSSB, PSA, SPP, HSS not meeting at the same time in different locations. As ad hoc virtual conferences were arranged, there were some unfortunate conflicts.","Other = care obligations that can be given over to partner when I'm away but not when I'm present.","It's not health to sit and stare at one area of a screen, rather than moving around, letting eyes roam, and otherwise being present.","Tech issues: As I said above, I only have a small screen, which makes being online very often really tiring. Also, internet connections are a major impairment. If half of my apartment building is streaming movies or both my wife and I are online for work, there are bumps in the connection. If speakers are in a location with a less-than-highspeed internet connection (i.e., in a lot of small towns in the US and Europe), there are glitches in their connection. Talks are a lot harder to follow online, and I have seen speakers' internet connections break down in the middle of their talks. Lack of adequate tech is going to be a problem for the foreseeable future, because people often have to buy their equipment privately (in particular grad students, researchers with bad funding situations, independent researchers) and often super-high-speed internet isn't available if they live in the countryside. Tech issues are going to create a huge gap between people who are well-funded, have tenure and work at first-rate institutions and people who are less well off.","Webinars are very alienating when there is no option for Q&A and they disable the chat. It feels like being silenced. The other barrier to being able to benefit from online conferences is that workshops and conferences I'd love to go to often conflict with my teaching schedule, student supervision, and university service obligations which in the pandemic are increasing for everyone. Going to an in-person conference allows us a break from at least some teaching and university service for at least that weekend in ways that the pandemic does not allow. There is now no 'off' anymore.","Generally the only sessions I can make for online conferences hosted in the UK or EU are ones scheduled for late afternoon or evening - a real frustration.","I understand that for many people care obligations make travel difficult. For me it's definitely been the reverse. When I travel to attend a conference, it's easy to get my kids to understand I'm on a work trip. My parents offer to help out with the kids. My kids' friends offer to host them for a dinner. Etc. But none of those things happen when I'm physically at home. Obviously, these are all social norms/expectations that could be changed. But I don't know how easily/quickly they could be changed.","Unstable connection (and I live in the UK!!) Inability to attend over long periods (I simply cannot manage this physically) Difficulty in getting to know people I did not already know before the online meeting started. Difficulty in involving audiences beyond core audience (e.g. bring in historians, scientists or social scientists into philosophy meetings).

Yet those are often the talks I am happiest to have attended during in-person conferences.","(What I have explained in response to 4 above.)","The 'other' is not that it is difficult, but, that given the limited social time (which I think is really important for discussing topics for future work and getting a feel for the edge of the field), it might not be worth my time (which is a shame!).","The background distractions of ordinary life.","Not special to me, but it's just socially awkward to connect on zoom.  And it isn't fun.","i only attend online meetings i must attend, which is already way too many. I didn't attend the PSA poster conferences for this reason, while I will go to the in person poster meeting in baltimore.","Care obligations; limited depth of engagement due to online nature of event","As noted above, my 'regular life' is in the way of meaningful immersion, and the lack of a 'standing community' (which is just a set of people around who are interested in talking, thinking, and/or debriefing about conference presentations) makes it very difficult to really get the best set of benefits from a conference. Additionally, the near impossibility of creating new collegial relationships (or reviving or cultivating old ones) is a huge loss on a 'stay at home and conference' model.","Conferences need to be scheduled differently to accommodate time zone differences and avoid zoom fatigue - but it can be done! And I have had to learn that if I participate in an online conference at night, I cannot also work ordinary office hours on top:-)","Global pandemics really harsh my conference mojo regardless of modality.","In general, the inability to engage with others on a more casual basis.","Care obligations. Not **physically** being apart from family / those I must care for means that I am less likely to prioritize myself and attend events when there is a conflict of responsibility.","Many more distractions, and too easy not to pay as close of attention as one would in person. The medium itself very much hinders the interaction and is far worse than the in person experience. Replacing the in person experience with fully online conferences erases extremely important contexts for building valuable working/research relations with other philosophers, and for brainstorming/collaborating together.","The answers to this question are grossly incomplete. Time zone differences? For in-person conferences, I will cross ten time zones. Online conferences lose everything that matters to me for in-person conferences: seeing old friends, making new friends, letting my mind freely wander during a random talk (which just doesn't happen when I'm so picky about choosing which zoom session to attend), getting some fresh air in a new city, random intellectual conversations with who knows whom. It's not just zoom fatigue ... it's general screen fatigue. So much of our lives have moved to screens -- reading, teaching, grading, dating, ordering groceries, choosing what socks to buy -- I just won't attend conferences on a screen. ","Artificiality of on line communication and environment..","Mobility limitations.","The time zone worry is a relatively weak argument for in-person events, in my opinion. When traveling abroad for a conference, there are also time zone differences. I have heard people lament this, but I think that reflects an unwillingness to treat online events the same way one would treat an in-person event. In other words, time zones are a problem regardless of whether the event is online or in-person.","I am retired.","Having children at home I found it difficult to muster up my professional persona and participate in remote conferences.  Being at home there were always more pressing things to do than academic conferences.  Getting physically away from home demands to in-person conferences is key to my being able to participate in the intellectual community.","If I'm not leaving home, it's much harder to preserve the time to attend events I'm excited about. I keep signing up for events and then not actually getting to them because something comes up at home and since it's 'optional' it's the thing to go. This wouldn't happen if I was away from home (even just across town at another campus)","The biggest problem is the ease of distraction. If I'm already staring at the screen, it's so easy to check my e-mail to remind myself not to be late to another appointment later that day, and then zone out for half the talk.","I don't know if this would be considered a sensory impairment, per se, but I guess I have a little bit of a hard time hearing people and find the sound over the computer to be difficult to hear.  In person, I sometimes rely on visual cues a bit (both lip reading and gestures), which aren't as visible/noticeable in Zoom settings, especially when there is a screen share and the speaker's block is much smaller.  Also, any kind of echo or lag can make these other cues less useful.","inability to make connections","Fear of being recorded","In my experience, most of the benefit from attending a conference comes from social interactions outside the actual talks. The talks are essential for providing a question period and to update the community on recent research. But they aren't the main reason I attend conferences.","Although I prefer meeting online, the time zone differences have been an inconvenience at times. (For example, 8am meetings on East Coast time are at 5am Alaska time!). But it’s still more convenient than jet lag at in-person meetings. Zoom fatigue is sometimes an issue at long conferences. (Sitting all at in-person conferences was also very draining.) It would be great if it were easy to call in to meetings. Going for a walk while attending presentations is an excellent way to beat zoom fatigue. If presenters describe their slides and assume that at least one participant cannot see the slides, that would help. (This should be assumed in any case for all presentations, even in-person).  If there were a way to call in and still have your name and picture appear, that would also help with networking.

Zoom is just not the same. However, I take it that small workshops, symposiums for particular issues, etc., are all movable online (with the benefit of having larger audiences than in-person). The big conferences already attract lots of people. But they are more costly environmentally. So I think moving most small conferences online (something PSA can only promote and suggest) and keeping some big conferences in-person (e.g., having every other biennal conference in-person) would reduce to 50% the carbon footprint without totally eliminating the benefits of in-person conferences.","I think we should have more conferences online, but not all. I would be very disappointed if the PSA went fully virtual, because it's my favorite large conference in terms of after-hours networking and socializing. Since it's the primary opportunity for philosophers of science to connect with one another, and since it's only held once every two years, I have a strong preference for keeping it F2F. I'd also like to mention that I think in-person meetings have a special importance for graduate students and early-career scholars. There's a higher barrier to meeting new people when things are virtual, and this is especially felt by less well-connected folks. Moreover, well-established senior faculty with busy schedules might appreciate the convenience of an online conference, but it makes them less accessible to relative outsiders.","I have spent a very lonely year at home alone. Zoom has been a necessary way to continue professional collaboration and has work well for departmental colloquia lasting no more than two hours. But conferences have not been as pleasant. I thought the PSA poster virtual format worked fairly well, but some posters were difficult to see because the fonts were too small. Also, I would have liked to walk around in a conference hall to chat more with some of the individual poster presenters. I really missed all the PSA activities, such as the special interest lunches, seeing everyone together at the Awards and Presidential Address, going to sessions in my areas of interest and hearing the talks and questions live, talking to colleagues from around the world at receptions, going out for dinner with friends I only see at PSA meetings, browsing at the book exhibit.

I always introduce myself to younger folks in a room, but I can\'t really do that (or don\'t know how) from a Zoom meeting. We have discussed this in our program, and we agree that virtual formats lead to less diversity and inclusion in many ways, even while allowing more people to "log on."',"One reason is that online socializing doesn't even work half as well as in-person socializing. It's important for everyone (and in particular for junior scholars) to have opportunities to informally chat to people. The software that emulates this doesn't do a good job: you have to actively move towards someone and interrupt their conversation to get to informally chat with them, there are no spontaneous opportunities such as ending up near someone in the breakfast line at the hotel, happening to use the same elevator, bumping into people at the aitport and taking the same train downtown, etc. Having the PSA fully online will reduce it to a talks and Q&A event without any of the real benefits that actual conferences have. Also, (and I'm sorry to say this) the PSA is a bit elitist and exclusive when it comes to who gets to present: it's the only conference in the (wider) field that expects 5,000-word papers instead of just an abstract and in addition has a comparatively low acceptance rate. Having such a high threshold with respect to who gets to go should come with a lot of benefits for those who get accepted. If the PSA is nothing more than just talks with Q&A, there will be less initiative to bother with writing a 5,000-word paper. (One might as well write a full-length paper and present it elsewhere.)","I have a giant caveat that goes along with this 'agree'. If the PSA is to have some sort of special reason to be in-person, then it should also make sure that it is truly inclusive. Not only continue to have other ways of allowing people to participate (like the in-person poster session, which is great) but also continue to include other ways to bring in people from groups that have been left out of the PSA meetings. I know that the PSA is committed to increasing diversity already but I think that we can (and must) do much more.","The PSA biennial conference, when held in-person, is a great networking event and is especially beneficial for grad students and early career scholars. I don't know if these benefits would be true of a remote version of the conference. Further, I don't know how many talks I would actually attend if it were held remotely (I'm guessing \"fewer\"). Finally, I don't know how much I would get out of each remote talk that I would attend (I'm guessing less than what I get out of each in-person talk). These are all cons. The pros, of course, are the reduction in carbon footprints. I don't know how to weigh the tradeoffs, so I selected \"unsure.\"","I think that a partly in person conference could be a good idea, mostly for the purposes of networking. However, if partially remote is not an option, then I think fully remote is better than fully in person.","The PSA biennial conference is likely the only conference I would attend in person on a regular basis - I plan to reduce my travel mainly w/respect to one-off lectures.","The PSA is one of the few events that allows me to explore so many areas of phil sci that I wouldn't otherwise learn about, while also catching up with so many colleagues working in my area -- the kind of interaction that, so far at least, I haven't seen replicated online. Further, the event can be held in a way that mitigates some of the travel cost, by putting it in a region where many participants will be able to attend by train/etc., and near a major airport so that most attendees won't need to take flights with multiple connections.","At least for me, the PSA would be the conference where I would expect to see a lot of my network in the same place at once. If we were only going to keep a small number of conferences in person, making the PSA one of them would maximize the benefits, from my perspective.","Since PSA meets only every other year and is an opportunity to hear a lot of new research and meeting many people in the field, it should continue to meet in person. Smaller conferences and meetings (10 speakers or less) can adequately achieve their goals without an in-person meeting, and certainly lecture series with one invited speaker should all be virtual.","To offset the problems with online meetings I listed above.","Though see above for my ideas about how PSA should be changed to facilitate / increase the amount of 'requires in-person' interactions","I never managed to participate in a psa meeting due to financial difficulties yet i do believe personal informal interactions are important. Certainly not every talk should be face to face but a meeting of one every two years is certainly important for those who could afford it.","I acknowledge that there will be tradeoffs, but I think we are at the point where we ought to do everything in our power to reduce our carbon footprints.","I wonder if PSA could be in person every four years and online every two years? It seems important that graduate students have a chance to do an in-person conference at least once during graduate school.","In-person conference is a magical thing. There is an (impossible to assess, I think) opportunity cost to moving it online, which I recognize is a case of trading tangible good (reducing carbon emission) for intangible, impossible to assess, possibly non-existing chance of extra magic. Personally, I decided to pursue philosophy because of my experience at an in-person meeting, and probably would not have pursued philosophy if I didn't have that. But that might be an anomaly and there might be people for whom the reverse is true.","I think there is a special reason to keep it in person because in my experience the PSA has been the main place for me (and others I know) as an early career scholar to meet people from around the world in the community. This is incredibly essential for building relationships that will last throughout my career. The scale and prestige of the conference makes it a natural place for scholars in the community to meet and socialize.","The field will die without a regular in-person meeting.","I believe that it should have both in-person and a remote activities. The remote activities should be just as selective in terms of quality and sufficiently rich that they would provide a great experience for people who can do only that.","This is a special meeting because it is the only main one for our discipline.  I think we should make virtual talks easy and common, though.","The PSA is unique in bringing the phil sci community together and vital for net-working and personal relations. Those just don't happen over zoom meeting. I participated in the PSA online poster meeting and that worked well I thought. If it was just about the academic content, I do think even the PSA conference could be conducted online. The massive scale of the talks will be a problem, if one would want to sit through the entire program. Then again, it is an issue also for the physical meeting! So ultimately it really comes down to whether one would want to sacrifice the social aspect. I personally would find it sad to do so entirely, but I'm definitely supportive of having more online meetings also in the future. For me personally, the problem of being away from my family (small kids) would be an even more important consideration than climate change. At least for the nearer future. So I probably would attend the online PSA version in the coming years if that was an option, but for admittedly more egoistic reasons.  ","the psa meeting is the raison d'etre of the society. This is what unifies it. it creates a sense of community that simply cannot be emulated online.","Favorite conference, super valuable, much would be lost if moved fully online.","As above. Also, the PSA's biennial nature is superior in this regard to many other conferences. Perhaps conferences could adopt an on-line version in alternating years.","I enjoy and benefit from some contacts that I take home from PSA and similar conferences. However, even as a tenured professor at research-emphasizing US university, I do not have an annual travel budget large enough to cover expenses for even one remote conference, much less two (as, for example, ISHPSSB normally happens the same fiscal year as PSA). Given that PSA normally also happens mid-semester, I find that attending PSA is sometimes hard to justify. Were there any other way to establish professional contacts and hear more sessions, it would be even harder to justify.","Personal engagement still seems to be an important modality for human interaction and career development. I fear for the younger generation of scholars, if in-person (or at least hybrid) meetings were cease without being sure that the alternative was viable. As somebody in a small institution (where I was the sole philosopher and one of only a small number of philosophers of science within the immediate geographical region), being able to connect with people at the PSA was very important to my early career. Once I became more established and settled in my career, foregoing meetings became more of an option for me, although I will admit that it has meant that I feel less in-touch with new developments being pursued by the younger, 'frontier scholars' of the field.","I'm inclined to disagree. But because the conference is biennial instead of annual, perhaps that would be a reason for me to answer more cautiously.","As I said in response to a question above: 'There's a whole range of stuff that isn't just captured under 'fostering existing relationships' and 'initiating new relationships'. There's a level of feedback on one's work, productive discussion about others' work, and generally productive philosophical discussion which is simply impossible (in my experience) with online events. I'm thinking, for example, of the chats that spontaneously linger after Q&A is over, and continue over a drink or a meal, and the random encounters in the halls in between sessions, and so forth. Those are immensely valuable (socially and professionally) and impossible to replicate online. This past year+ has made me realize how much those interactions—even more so than the talks and Q&A—are the real substance of the benefit I get from conferences.' I think the PSA is an exceptionally valuable and important forum, in our discipline, for these sorts of interactions. It would be a huge loss to get rid of that.","Community is essential for doing philosophy well, and community-building is best done in person.  I don't think even the best technology can change the fact that we are social organisms who relate as social organisms.  PSA is the premier conference for philosophy of science... or at least it used to be.  To continue to function as a community we need to meet face to face from time to time.","There's a huge value-added by being physically in person with other like-minded scholars, for the longer chats in the hallways, at meals, over coffee and beer, &c. I could let APAs go and pick and choose my spots with online conferences, but I *really* want to keep going with in-person PSA meetings.","I find it hard to judge how such a relatively large event would work online. Of course the environmental gains are especially big. And interaction works best in small groups. However, the PSA conference is special","The PSA biennial conference is sufficiently general that the interactions it generates---between individuals would likely not seek out interaction on an online forum---are beneficial to the discipline as a whole. Additionally, it is only held once every 2 years. I would certainly advocate against moving to an annual conference, and would even advocate for the various APA conferences to become biennial events.  Even if we granted that an in-person PSA every other year was too much of a carbon footprint, I would argue that a PSA every 3 years is a better solution than moving them online.","I take it that PSA has a contract with the hotel, so it will be financially liable.","I don't have the data to evaluate the antecedent and have a hard time thinking about the consequent without the data. I don't think the PSA is more 'special' (i.e. privileged) relative to other conferences.","I really do believe this. The PSA is a wonderful conference, and has made me feel part of a community in a way that most other conferences, both big and small, that I've been to simply have not.  There's something really edifying and inclusive about it -- and it's only every couple of years after all. ","As noted above, I believe strongly that the benefits of in-person conferences are numerous and simply cannot be replicated in online formats.","Again, I think it's important that it's the largest conference for philosophy of science. I think there are also things about the online experience that don't make sense for a large conference. It's the best time to see people from a wide variety of places and to have those informal interactions that make conferences fun. It's nice to go somewhere once every other year. The poster session is a very hard thing to translate online.","On the one hand, I strongly believe that we should do our best to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. On the other, I feel that the in-person PSA conferences are very important opportunity for networking, which are hard to replace with virtual conferences without impairing their functions to facilitate networking.","The social interactions that are possible are not completely compensated for by the remote interactions.  Informal conversations and personal relationship remain an integral part of intellectual life.","On line communication is a hollow substitute for real embodied human communication. It's fine for limited, temporary purposes but it is dehumanizing as a replacement for genuine human interaction, which both scientific and philosophical communication requires.","My sense is that PSA because it happens only every other year and has an international draw, the in-person meeting is justifiable.","Many, but not all, conferences ought to retain the social component—and the biennial conference especially","I honestly think that despite the drawbacks of a fully in-person conference, until we figure out how to have better online conferences--and we are very far--95% of every PSA should be in person.  This is based on the assumption that we can address the impact of international or even domestic travel using offsets.  If offsets are not enough or not appropriate, then I am not sure what to do.  Maybe PSA and EPSA should coordinate times and have some periods that are joint and online, but that the rest of each conference is in person.  We could do this with societies on other continents as well.","What's special about PSA? Infrequency doesn't in itself make for a good argument.","I see no reason that the talks must be in person and there are some advantages to virtual talks. The ability to record talks is a large benefit. I think the PSA biennial meeting serves a lot of professional functions via the components of the program other than the talks. I suspect that many of these functions can be accomplished virtually, but it will require some thinking about how to do this well. More than that, I think it will require a commitment from all of us to treat online conferences like we treat in-person conferences rather than popping in for a few talks and turning our video off.","I'm more inclined to agree than disagree, for reasons that I can only sketch here. If we think that research in the philosophy of science is worthwhile, then we must think that to some extent it is worth expending resources on it that have alternative valuable uses. Those resources include the generation of some amount of CO2 (not only by traveling). I think that in-person conferences provide not only a forum for the scheduled exchange of ideas (which can be accomplished online) but also unplanned and unplannable opportunities for making new contacts and exchanging ideas. It is therefore possible in principle, and not implausible in practice, that the benefits of in-person conferences (in terms of promoting worthwhile research in the philosophy of science) exceed the costs (including in terms of carbon emissions). Carbon emissions have instrumental benefits (as well, of course, as costs), and the benefits need to be considered as well as the costs: they make good things possible that cannot be obtained without incurring other costs that also matter. I take it that we do not have reliable empirical estimates of the magnitudes of the costs and benefits in this particular case (in-person conferences). What I am resisting is the apriorism involved in assuming that the costs must exceed the benefits; there is no 'must' about it.","PSA meetings only happen every two years and bring together a diversity of researchers unlike any other conference. Virtual conference participation cannot replicate the in person conference. I would be much less likely to attend.","The PSA is, for me, one of the top three hubs for my intellectual life in a way that, e.g., the APA isn't. I think it's because of the size -- it's big enough to have most of the people I engage with in philosophy of science present, but small enough that there aren't a ton of people from other specialties I don't know. Of all the conferences I attend, it would be the last, or maybe one of the two last, opportunities to see my community that I would want to lose.","It is a major conference that only takes place every other year.","But I don't agree that more workshops should take place remotely.","I believe there must be a focus for in person meetings due to the importance of contingent interaction (informal meetings and the unexpected things that happen when present at conferences) that cannot be easily duplicated online and to promote a sense of community. But we should also work on novel online approaches to facilitate ways to enhance the remote participant experience.","If I'm honest, I'm not interested in fully virtual conferences. I've stopped agreeing to speak at them, and hardly attend them. If I so I am usually distracted. I've had a very hard time duplicating a virtual conference the networking opportunities, friend-building experiences, and emotional excitement that come with in person conferences. The PSA is the most important conference I attend; I do not think I would be as diverse and interesting of a scholar had I not (somewhat randomly) entered into certain conversations at the PSA meeting. I doubt these conversations would ever have taken place if the conference were online only. I think there should be an environmental review of what we can do better. I am willing to purchase offsets for my travel, to sponsor a graduate student's 'green' travel, to reduce food waste at the conference, to hold the conference someplace other than a boring hotel and conference center. I hope that the impact of such programs is investigated before the biannual conference is moved fully online. ","The PSA is the most important conference and the benefits of physical attendance are especially high due to the presence of so many great friends and colleagues.","Only when,if early career researchers benefit from in-person activities might enable them to build technical and non-technical capabilities by engaging with leaders in the specific discipline.","The large scale social aspect of PSA is still important and cannot easily be replicated online.  We need fewer, better in-person meetings in the profession.  PSA is likely going to be one of those fewer, better meetings.","I absolutely think virtual participation should be permitted as a basic precondition of future in-person conferences. But there are special reasons for big meetings, especially biennial ones, to have an in-person component.","I'm unsure how significant a consideration this is. However, although geographical isolation makes it more difficult to attend the PSA and other large conferences, and although attendance involves air travel, these conferences often represent the only opportunity for those of us in the southern hemisphere to meet colleagues and make new connections in person. And if conferences have online options, our institutions will almost certainly cancel such travel entirely. Perhaps that is ultimately a good thing, but it is very hard to be a part of the international community as things already are.","The PSA is such a big conference that the advantages of an in-person conference are less pronounced than in the case of smaller conferences or workshops. Thus, if anything I think there is a special reason to hold the PSA online or in a hybrid form, even though I believe that other conferences and workshops would loose more by making this move.","In-person events are perhaps the only opportunities for junior scholars (especially those from less-than-stellar academic backgrounds) to get to know other scholars.","Online is simply inferior.","For most people, there is some conference that is their 'home' in the discipline, where they can go, and expect to see a good proportion of their friends and colleagues that they interact with in writing and online. The PSA serves that role for many people.","Any in-person conference should include a required mechanism by which all of the carbon produced by the conference and each of the participants is verifiably offset 110% by any number of reduction/offset strategies. This will create a higher cost conference, but the higher cost will be and investment rather than an expense.","I think we should promote a robust hybrid model with a recommendation/ restriction on time-flights for example.","I don't think there is any special reason for PSA or the discipline that requires the biennial conference to be held in person. I think (and hope) that we will have a lot of opportunities for (safe) in-person contact at our home institutions or with shorter-distance in-person events.","The PSA is the my only opportunity to meet with my North-American friends and colleagues. It would be a great loss not to have this any more. And one transatlantic flight every other year is not bringing about the world's end (in particular given that I am buying offsets for it).","I have a hard time imagining how much the lack of social interactions will impact the overall experience/use of the conference. On the other hand, as it is I have no money to travel so I could not attend at all if it were not online.","Hybrid meeting would be best. It is important especially to younger scholars to socialize. I personally don't like to travel that much anymore. More importantly, the hybrid mode would allow more papers, more participants, and less financial constraints. There is so much gate-keeping taking place due to the in-person format that restricts the number of papers to be presented. I've been myself in the PSA programme committee, and I have to say that apart from some very clear cases it was really difficult to decide what papers to accept and what to reject. There few if any outstanding papers, a few not acceptable ones, and the majority of the papers were well-written, and OK.","Remote conferences, at present, diminish the attention and importance of contributions. Attendance is less appealing. This hurts the field. There is no back and forth questioning, and no opportunity for detailed communications outside of a session. Most of the attention goes to worrying about technical glitches. We don't meet new scholars.","There are benefits to serendipitous interaction in an environment away from home.","I think as a flagship conference for philosophy of science, the PSA meeting has an important professional function for the field. But I do think that if participants have to take long-distance flights to join PSA, the should commit to not taking other long-distance flights that year.","The PSA meetings play an important role in fostering community among philosophers of science. I am introvert and a bit socially awkward, and I have never felt very comfortable or welcome at APA meetings. Over the years I have come to feel that PSA is a kind of academic home. That function can not be filled online.","In-person (social) interaction is an important benefit of PSA meetings.","The benefit gained from social interaction outside the talks is not possible with an exclusively online format.","Perhaps it does not need to be biennial. Once every three years would probably suffice.","Philosophical research can be lonely, but these conferences create a sense of community. Especially so the PSA, where philosophers of science make an effort to gather, and sometimes come even if they're not presenting. I would go as far as stating that the social/informal aspect of it is more important than the mere exchange of information or philosophical views. It's also important for the discipline to create a sense of community: one i more likely to be more charitable and fair to the papers of an author one has met in the flesh.","I think we would lose what makes the PSA and other conferences special by hosting them online. In my opinion, the value in such meetings lies primarily in the kinds of informal interactions that they facilitate, for which the formal parts serve as jumping-off points. I also think there is so much more to gain by being in a room with people than being at home over zoom. My experience giving and attending zoom talks has left me feeling empty. Fostering and building community is best done in person.","Unlike more specialized conferences, where a lot of the participants are already familiar with each other’s research, the breadth of PSA permits participants to learn about research they were not familiar with before or meet researchers they otherwise would not have an opportunity to meet.","social part, and meeting colleagues."]},{id:"onlinePreference",question:"14. Additional Thoughts about Conferences and Climate Change",responses:["I think the PSA has already been far in advance of other professional organizations like the APA. I think three APA meetings every year is a waste of time for those organizing and on program committees, and that either the divisions should meet biennially like the PSA, or they should combine meetings for a single larger one (even though some people would travel farther, there would be less net overall travel to a single meeting).  The PSa has gained so much amazing momentum since I started attending decades ago. It is irreplaceable for junior scholars and graduate students especially, in the in-person format. we would lose our identity as a field, and lose the ability to do really niche and amazing work, if this goes virtual.  I think the PSA deserves credit for already halving their conference footprint by meeting biennially instead of yearly. The EPSA is now taking off and there is much less pressure for European and British philosophers of science to fly to North America for the PSA. These speak greatly in favour of keeping this as the unifying North American biennial in-person meeting.","There is no substitute for meeting in-person. I'd usually prefer just to read a talk rather than listen to it online, and talk to others one-to-one rather than participate in an online group event. Given the inconvenience and climate cost of travel, this is unfortunate, but it's true.","If live sessions could be recorded and made available on line, that would be very helpful. Often there are overlapping session conflicts. Perhaps some virtual sessions could be added on non-conference days for those who can't or don't wish to travel and included with recordings of the in-person sessions. This would be one way to do a hybrid conference.","I have found that if I'm attending remotely, I listen to a few things in a meeting but only a few. If I'm there in person, I'm \"there\" and attend meetings and carry out business all the time. It's a huge difference. I'm skipping a lot of remote meetings that I would have attended.","Professional life is a lot more than staring at a computer all day. As philosophers most of our reading and writing already has been online for some time. Administrators now start pushing online teaching because it's a lot cheaper than the real thing. (If students can watch recorded lectures, why pay someone to perform the same lecture every year?) If we start giving administrators reasons to cut even more (travel funding, for example), we can be certain they will do so. Also, on a personal note: in the past year I have attended workshops and conferences online, I taught online, I gave exams online, I went to board and faculty meetings online, I read articles and books online, I wrote papers online, I edited a journal online, I collaborated with others online, I had drinks with friends online, I met family members online, I went to a wedding online, and I went to a funeral online. I'm so done with this. I'm very concerned about climate change, but all this online work is affecting me.","While I recognize the need to have more (all?) events that would require airline travel online, this doesn't change the fact that online conferences simply aren't fun and even seem to have diminished value. I partly feel like the new freedom to attend virtual conferences all over the world has an associated downside--something like the so-called paradox of choice or the Netflix-ification of academia. By this I just mean that when conferences are held online, one has so many more to choose from--there's basically something every week or more--and so each conference is easier to flake on, or to attend for 15 minutes and then divert your attention elsewhere, etc., because there's always another option later that week or next. As a result the value of each conference goes down. This is in addition to (but may exacerbate) zoom fatigue.","Whether I would attend the PSA meeting in person has to do with whether my university begins allowing us to expense conference travel. Until that happens, it probably wouldn't make sense financially for me to attend in person, especially if there is a remote option. I thus think that the option to present/attend remotely has to be maintained, even if COVID numbers are much improved by the fall.","I know hybrid meetings are expensive and complicated to run, but I'd really appreciate having the option to attend remotely or, in the case of the PSA biennial meetings, attend in person. And I am sure that if remote options were available a great many philosophers of science who can't typically attend these meetings in person would participate; I see remote options are a way to significantly expand access to PSA meetings.","If the PSA were held remotely, I would neither submit nor attend. The principle benefit for me of the conference cannot be replicated online.","I think that PSA is a conference that provides benefits that cannot be realized (easily) in a purely online format. Of course, there are some elements of the conference that could be moved online (e.g., the talks), but for me, the main benefits are the discussions, interactive Q&As, and spontaneous conversations. I have not found any good way to replicate those in a virtual setting (and yes, I've used tools like Gather -- they're okay, but I still find them inferior in various ways). I think that there are many conferences that probably should go fully remote, but I don't think that PSA is one of them.","If I had co-presenters who were traveling I would most likely join them, but otherwise would opt to participate remotely.","I like the idea of a hybrid conference format.  To me one of the most important parts of the PSA is meeting new people and doing one-on-one or small group networking.  So one of the things that I would love to see included in a virtual format would be a way to facilitate 10 or 15 minute meetings with people who haven't previously met, but where at least one party wants to meet.  Eg if a graduate student wanted to meet a medium famous person, or a person who works in their area of interest, rather than scheming to run into them at a panel they could sign up for a brief Zoom meeting.  Maybe there could be a lottery for slots, or a med-school-matching algorithm (stable matching algorithm) that paired people interested in meeting based on a list of preferences.","To further explain my answers to 12 and 13: if PSA is held hybrid, I would most likely feel a sense of moral judgment for those who still decide to fly in.","This is an imporant topic for people to be thinking carefully about. Thank you for pursing this study.","There is a lot lost in the current format of virtual meetings.","I marked 'unsure' on #12, because it would depend on the location. If the meeting were relatively local, I'd try to attend in person. If it were further away, I'd be more likely to attend virtually.","Host location also matters somewhat for preferences for in person vs remote","We should advocate for mechanisms for achieving global reduction in carbon use, too.","We need more (night) trains!","I find it challenging to answer this question now. I will need to see what the COVID / vaccination levels are closer to the event date.","I do not think that virtual meetings can replace in-person completely.  What I would like to advocate is that philosophers of science are much more efficient about the way they spend their carbon budgets generally. In agreement with the 'default' question above, I think the starting position should be to do local stuff with virtual long-distance links if necessary, to the extent that that can be made to work.  Some circumstances are special -- eg big retirement events for a beloved supervisor etc.  But the reflexive agreement to burn carbon for an academic meeting -- which we often (and even explicitly) just use as an excuse to go see some city or see our friends, and often on taxpayer's money -- really has to stop.  I really believe there is a 'special obligation' on philosophers of science to 'walk the walk' on climate change. Certainly, those for whom their moral conscience interferes with their ability to travel should have their beliefs respected by all: it's not like they are unreasonable beliefs after all.  That itself is a huge consideration in favour of a more virtual or at least hybrid approach to academic meetings in general. I also am unsure that a consideration often given in favour of having in-person as opposed to virtual meetings -- namely, that it is very important for emerging scholars to rub shoulders with influential more established ones -- is as weighty as it is often regarded. The inter-campus Zoom reading group, for example, has proved a fantastic way for grad students to interact with important people, and one that can focus on relevant intellectual ability more than would be the case in bar setting etc (where all sorts of biases come into play). Also, it levels the playing field for excellent grad students from colleges (like mine) which cannot offer travel funding that competes from more upscale institutions.   (I should say also to people who make this argument that it does make philosophy as it stands seem rather corrupt! -- Which is of course reason to think that the status quo itself is indeed a bit corrupt...) ","One of the great joys of my career are the friendships I have made in conferences. I'm talking about people who were invited to my wedding years ago, friends who during conference social time opened up about deep family difficulties, friends who will be in my life forever. My former PhD supervisor, my former PhD students, my nemeses, my collaborators. The thing I miss the most about my work during Covid has been seeing these people. These connections must happen in person. Zoom conferences are a chore. I have a good job. If conferences move online, I won't bother with them. I'm in the middle stages of my career, full of energy and enthusiasm. I want to go to conferences, for all the reasons I have already mentioned, and to foster the projects of younger scholars. If PSA goes online, I won't attend. Zoom is a chore, not a joy, unlike in-person PSA conferences.","I do think that a hybrid format is a good idea, however, I would want to continue having in person contact with those working in my areas of interest. While I intend to attend fewer in person conferences in the future, PSA is one meeting that I would be likely to attend in person.","It is much harder when attending an online conference to disengage from the demands of home and work as one can when traveling.  Also, the exigencies of finding food and other necessities when in an unfamiliar location foster spontaneous and serendipitous encounters that just don't happen with online meetings.","Re #12, I would attend in person unless most of the conference were online.","The climate change issue is very important, but there are obviously other social reasons to go online. Not all academics have the resources or ability to travel given their other obligations/limitations. This morning I was on a philsci panel with colleagues in India. I would not have easily been able to engage with colleagues in India in a panel were it not for the virtual format. If philosophers of science want to engage more with people in various parts of the world, virtual is one way to do that. I think this is an important issue and I worry that the profession is at risk of reverting to the way things used to be pre-pandemic because we all yearn for a return to 'normal', which to my mind is close to problematic golden age thinking. There were some limitations with the way things were, and I hope we don't miss this opportunity to innovate and do better. Thanks for running this survey and I'm always happy to discuss further. -Jon Fuller, Pitt HPS (JPF53@pitt.edu)","I have not given a single talk remotely this past year and a half, nor have I participated in any conferences except those most essential (e.g. at my home institution).  The move to online, though necessary given the circumstances, has led to my exclusion from the field, despite being from an underrepresented group in philosophy of science.  There seems to be an assumption that online is always more inclusive and always better for working parents--this is certainly not the case based on my own experience.","In my view, 50% reduction of GHG emission by 2030 is not achievable, because alternative technology is not ready to achieve this. More innovation is needed and it will take time.","There is so much value in person-to-person interaction, that I feel that more low-attendance, highly specialized conferences should be hybrid, whereas major conferences like PSA should be predominantly in person (perhaps with a remote option) and—like PSA—consider going to every other year.  There are so many conferences and meetings that the amount of travel could be greatly reduced while still maintaining many face-to-face opportunities at flagship meetings.","I think this whole survey is really unfortunate. First, whoever created it seems to have designed it to provide as much support as possible for remote options.  I get no sense at all that the creators of this survey are trying to honestly survey PSA opinion about these issues rather than trying to drum up support for an agenda. I say this as someone who thinks the climate emergency is very  serious and our failure as a country to so far address it is catastrophic. But holding PSA meetings virtually is not going to  fix anything. The entire survey seems to  frame things in terms of personal virtue/virtual signaling/ empty symbolism  and there seems to little concern for what would be lost if PSA were to stop holding PSA meetings.Want to do something about climate change? Act outside of the PSA. Join and support the right political organizations. Run for congress. Sue the Koch brothers out of existence. Also maybe you say somewhere that responses to this survey are anonymized-- I assume this is the case-- but if so, you should highlight this. ","Working in South Korea, I rarely attend the PSA due to the distance. Hybrid meetings would make the biennial conference more accessible for me as well as more environmentally responsible.","I'm wondering what options have been discussed besides moving the PSA biannual meeting fully online? This survey seems very targeted towards that end, while other options might exist. Maybe, for example, a big biannual meeting doesn't make sense anymore. Perhaps having smaller regional meetings - with the ability to attend via zoom - could attenuate the carbon footprint. Or, perhaps, one could cut down carbon emissions significantly by holding the conference yearly, once in America, and once in Europe, with strong virtual components to dissuade participants from traveling across the pond. Or, perhaps there should be special events via zoom that begin to model what an excellent online biannual meeting might look like, so that participants can gauge the effectiveness and refine a mode of operation to be implemented down the road. Or, carbon offset and green travel fund would be great, with encouragement to travel via train and carpool. How far can we get with these actions?","Carbon offsetting should be part of the mandatory registration fee for in-person meetings. A carbon off-setting fee should also be part of online meetings, since they are not carbon free.","I think it is important to include virtual participation on an equal footing, and livestream all sessions where possible.","I anticipate that my answers to questions 11 to 14 may look a bit inconsistent. But in question 11 I was asked for general reasoning that is not linked to my personal situation or preferences, in question 12 and 13 it was about me. T","I agree with the cause of reducing the number of in-person events. Still, it would be nice if we could countervail its shortcoming by having more online meetings with specific aims (e.g., mentoring, workshop, etc).","Zoom/screen fatigue is pretty bad. I definitely couldn't do a full-day of attending zoom presentations. And this makes socializing on zoom pretty draining, because it is physically/mentally uncomfortable. But of course, it is convenient and cost-effective to not have to travel.","I just don’t think ending all in person meetings is the best option all in.","An important way to cut the carbon intensity of an in-person conference is to host it in a place close to the 'center of gravity' of the membership, with a major hub airport that a very significant fraction of attendees can get to on a single flight, rather than requiring a connection (which doubles the takeoffs and landings).","It would be inaccurate to believe that by simply having conferences online we are doing enough to meet our responsibilities regarding climate volatility with its myriad ancillary problems, physical, economic and human. Our Vision should be one of investing-giving up something more than convenience-in order to become as responsible as we can possibly be. ","I think the choice to participate remotely will be based on the location of the next PSA.","In my experience, the smaller the size of the conference, the more successful it is at fostering the kind of collegiality and communication that is difficult to reproduce online.  Large conferences like the PSA are probably better held online.","It could be worth to do 2024 all online to just see how it goes and learn from that. If I were in a position to go to the in person meeting I would prefer that (for selfish reasons: I would just really enjoy the overall experience and seeing everybody again) but I am not.","In the remote conferences I attended, the attention and excitement to sessions on which we worked very hard to organize was seriously diminished. This is especially hurtful for novel, controversial ideas, and for minorities and women to expand professional interactions. There's much less incentive to organize sessions for an on-line conference.","As indicated in 11) I will commit to take no other long-distance flight in 2024 if I joing PSA in-person","We are social biological emotional beings. Remote interactions can supply information or complement in-person interactions, but never replace them. We must continue to develop clean energies and environmental adapted transportations.  ","Thank you for taking on this issue! I am a PhD student and I will reiterate what is well-known,  that my generation is deeply concerned with this issue. The organizations and conferences that make the shift to cultures of distance inclusion will be the ones that thrive.","I think the idea of having two tracks for all conferences makes sense. Have the typical in-person track for people for whom that is the best choice, as there are benefits to in-person conferences that I don't think can be replicated. But, then create a robust online version. Not just half assed recording of sessions thrown up all together on the same webpage. Put some thought and investment into it so that it has the flow and energy of a real conference. Allow for those breakout sessions, no matter how awkward. Make sure the filming and audio are done well, and stay in close communication with folks who are attending remotely. Very often those of us who attend events remotely end up feeling like second class citizens compared to people there in person.","I feel strongly about mitigating the effects of climate change, but I also don't think that we should do so at the expense of invaluable professional and personal interactions. Rather than hosting conferences online, I would much rather that we lower the number of conferences we attend, and preferentially attend local conferences. Given that the PSA is already a biennial conference, I think that hosting it online would be a tremendous loss. I have no opposition to having some sessions online at an in-person conference, but I would not attend them.","At the APA I was delighted to meet conference participants from around the world. The time zone differences were an issue there. I can envision meetings that are at convenient times for all or most of the US, for example, but scheduling decent times for global participants is more of a challenge. (Of course, jet lag for global participants in in-person meetings is an even bigger issue.)","We should have fewer conferences but all of them should be in person, I believe."]}];c.use([d,m]),function(){for(const e in p)f(p[e])}(),function e(){if(window.addEventListener("resize",e),document.documentElement.clientWidth<1024||I)return;I=!0,A.forEach((e=>x(e,null,"h2",1,"parentElement"))),S.forEach((e=>x(e,"h2","h3",2,"parentElement","parentElement"))),P.forEach((e=>x(e,"h3","graph",3,"parentElement"))),T(j(k,null))}(),q.forEach((e=>{const{id:t,responses:n,question:o}=e,i=document.getElementById(t).parentElement,a=document.createElement("div");a.classList.add("container-comments");const s=document.createElement("p");s.classList.add("comments-title");const r=o||"Comments";s.textContent=r,a.append(s);const l=document.createElement("div");l.classList.add("swiper"),a.append(l);const h=document.createElement("div");h.classList.add("swiper-wrapper"),l.append(h),n.forEach((e=>{const t=document.createElement("div");t.classList.add("swiper-slide");const n=document.createElement("p");n.textContent=e,t.append(n),h.append(t)}));const d=document.createElement("div");d.classList.add("swiper-pagination"),l.append(d);const m=document.createElement("div");m.classList.add("swiper-button-prev"),l.append(m);const u=document.createElement("div");u.classList.add("swiper-button-next"),l.append(u),i.insertAdjacentElement("afterend",a),new c(".swiper",{direction:"horizontal",loop:!0,pagination:{el:".swiper-pagination",type:"fraction"},navigation:{nextEl:".swiper-button-next",prevEl:".swiper-button-prev"}})}));
