      "I will not consider a PSA virtual conference. Close to worthless.",
      "Many of its key functions surrounding networking and collegiality occur in person.",
      "I can only speak for myself and respect that others will have reasons for wanting to continue to meet in person.",
      "If I only ever go to one conference in person again, it should be the PSA. I will go virtual for every single one, except this. There is no replacement for an in-person PSA.",
      "See comment above.",
      "I think there should be space for in-person conferences. Zoom is just not the same. However, I take it that small workshops, symposiums for particular issues, etc., are all movable online (with the benefit of having larger audiences than in-person). The big conferences already attract lots of people. But they are more costly environmentally. So I think moving most small conferences online (something PSA can only promote and suggest) and keeping some big conferences in-person (e.g., having every other biennal conference in-person) would reduce to 50% the carbon footprint without totally eliminating the benefits of in-person conferences.",
      "I think we should have more conferences online, but not all. I would be very disappointed if the PSA went fully virtual, because it's my favorite large conference in terms of after-hours networking and socializing. Since it's the primary opportunity for philosophers of science to connect with one another, and since it's only held once every two years, I have a strong preference for keeping it F2F. I'd also like to mention that I think in-person meetings have a special importance for graduate students and early-career scholars. There's a higher barrier to meeting new people when things are virtual, and this is especially felt by less well-connected folks. Moreover, well-established senior faculty with busy schedules might appreciate the convenience of an online conference, but it makes them less accessible to relative outsiders.",
      "I have spent a very lonely year at home alone. Zoom has been a necessary way to continue professional collaboration and has work well for departmental colloquia lasting no more than two hours. But conferences have not been as pleasant. I thought the PSA poster virtual format worked fairly well, but some posters were difficult to see because the fonts were too small. Also, I would have liked to walk around in a conference hall to chat more with some of the individual poster presenters. I really missed all the PSA activities, such as the special interest lunches, seeing everyone together at the Awards and Presidential Address, going to sessions in my areas of interest and hearing the talks and questions live, talking to colleagues from around the world at receptions, going out for dinner with friends I only see at PSA meetings, browsing at the book exhibit. I do hope we can meet in Baltimore in the fall.",
      "The value of socialising and informal interaction is less in a bigger meeting such as the PSA biennial conference than in smaller more focused workshops. So I actually think this is the kind of conference that could reasonably go online.",
      "I don't find that I make \"connections\" remotely with large groups. There is no real way to \"circulate\" at a mixer to meet younger scholars, for example, so I haven't met as many this past year as usual. I always introduce myself to younger folks in a room, but I can't really do that (or don't know how) from a Zoom meeting. We have discussed this in our program, and we agree that virtual formats lead to less diversity and inclusion in many ways, even while allowing more people to \"log on.\"",
      "One reason is that online socializing doesn't even work half as well as in-person socializing. It's important for everyone (and in particular for junior scholars) to have opportunities to informally chat to people. The software that emulates this doesn't do a good job: you have to actively move towards someone and interrupt their conversation to get to informally chat with them, there are no spontaneous opportunities such as ending up near someone in the breakfast line at the hotel, happening to use the same elevator, bumping into people at the aitport and taking the same train downtown, etc. Having the PSA fully online will reduce it to a talks and Q&A event without any of the real benefits that actual conferences have. Also, (and I'm sorry to say this) the PSA is a bit elitist and exclusive when it comes to who gets to present: it's the only conference in the (wider) field that expects 5,000-word papers instead of just an abstract and in addition has a comparatively low acceptance rate. Having such a high threshold with respect to who gets to go should come with a lot of benefits for those who get accepted. If the PSA is nothing more than just talks with Q&A, there will be less initiative to bother with writing a 5,000-word paper. (One might as well write a full-length paper and present it elsewhere.)",
      "I have a giant caveat that goes along with this 'agree'. If the PSA is to have some sort of special reason to be in-person, then it should also make sure that it is truly inclusive. Not only continue to have other ways of allowing people to participate (like the in-person poster session, which is great) but also continue to include other ways to bring in people from groups that have been left out of the PSA meetings. I know that the PSA is committed to increasing diversity already but I think that we can (and must) do much more.",
      "The PSA biennial conference, when held in-person, is a great networking event and is especially beneficial for grad students and early career scholars. I don't know if these benefits would be true of a remote version of the conference. Further, I don't know how many talks I would actually attend if it were held remotely (I'm guessing \"fewer\"). Finally, I don't know how much I would get out of each remote talk that I would attend (I'm guessing less than what I get out of each in-person talk). These are all cons. The pros, of course, are the reduction in carbon footprints. I don't know how to weigh the tradeoffs, so I selected \"unsure.\"",
      "I think that a partly in person conference could be a good idea, mostly for the purposes of networking. However, if partially remote is not an option, then I think fully remote is better than fully in person.",
      "The PSA biennial conference is likely the only conference I would attend in person on a regular basis - I plan to reduce my travel mainly w/respect to one-off lectures.",
      "The PSA is one of the few events that allows me to explore so many areas of phil sci that I wouldn't otherwise learn about, while also catching up with so many colleagues working in my area -- the kind of interaction that, so far at least, I haven't seen replicated online. Further, the event can be held in a way that mitigates some of the travel cost, by putting it in a region where many participants will be able to attend by train/etc., and near a major airport so that most attendees won't need to take flights with multiple connections.",
      "At least for me, the PSA would be the conference where I would expect to see a lot of my network in the same place at once. If we were only going to keep a small number of conferences in person, making the PSA one of them would maximize the benefits, from my perspective.",
      "Since PSA meets only every other year and is an opportunity to hear a lot of new research and meeting many people in the field, it should continue to meet in person. Smaller conferences and meetings (10 speakers or less) can adequately achieve their goals without an in-person meeting, and certainly lecture series with one invited speaker should all be virtual.",
      "To offset the problems with online meetings I listed above.",
      "Though see above for my ideas about how PSA should be changed to facilitate / increase the amount of 'requires in-person' interactions",
      "I never managed to participate in a psa meeting due to financial difficulties yet i do believe personal informal interactions are important. Certainly not every talk should be face to face but a meeting of one every two years is certainly important for those who could afford it.",
      "I acknowledge that there will be tradeoffs, but I think we are at the point where we ought to do everything in our power to reduce our carbon footprints.",
      "I wonder if PSA could be in person every four years and online every two years? It seems important that graduate students have a chance to do an in-person conference at least once during graduate school.",
      "In-person conference is a magical thing. There is an (impossible to assess, I think) opportunity cost to moving it online, which I recognize is a case of trading tangible good (reducing carbon emission) for intangible, impossible to assess, possibly non-existing chance of extra magic. Personally, I decided to pursue philosophy because of my experience at an in-person meeting, and probably would not have pursued philosophy if I didn't have that. But that might be an anomaly and there might be people for whom the reverse is true.",
      "I think there is a special reason to keep it in person because in my experience the PSA has been the main place for me (and others I know) as an early career scholar to meet people from around the world in the community. This is incredibly essential for building relationships that will last throughout my career. The scale and prestige of the conference makes it a natural place for scholars in the community to meet and socialize.",
      "The field will die without a regular in-person meeting.",
      "I believe that it should have both in-person and a remote activities. The remote activities should be just as selective in terms of quality and sufficiently rich that they would provide a great experience for people who can do only that.",
      "This is a special meeting because it is the only main one for our discipline.  I think we should make virtual talks easy and common, though.",
      "The PSA is unique in bringing the phil sci community together and vital for net-working and personal relations. Those just don't happen over zoom meeting. I participated in the PSA online poster meeting and that worked well I thought. If it was just about the academic content, I do think even the PSA conference could be conducted online. The massive scale of the talks will be a problem, if one would want to sit through the entire program. Then again, it is an issue also for the physical meeting! So ultimately it really comes down to whether one would want to sacrifice the social aspect. I personally would find it sad to do so entirely, but I'm definitely supportive of having more online meetings also in the future. For me personally, the problem of being away from my family (small kids) would be an even more important consideration than climate change. At least for the nearer future. So I probably would attend the online PSA version in the coming years if that was an option, but for admittedly more egoistic reasons.  ",
      "the psa meeting is the raison d'etre of the society. This is what unifies it. it creates a sense of community that simply cannot be emulated online.",
      "Favorite conference, super valuable, much would be lost if moved fully online.",
      "As above. Also, the PSA's biennial nature is superior in this regard to many other conferences. Perhaps conferences could adopt an on-line version in alternating years.",
      "I enjoy and benefit from some contacts that I take home from PSA and similar conferences. However, even as a tenured professor at research-emphasizing US university, I do not have an annual travel budget large enough to cover expenses for even one remote conference, much less two (as, for example, ISHPSSB normally happens the same fiscal year as PSA). Given that PSA normally also happens mid-semester, I find that attending PSA is sometimes hard to justify. Were there any other way to establish professional contacts and hear more sessions, it would be even harder to justify.",
      "Personal engagement still seems to be an important modality for human interaction and career development. I fear for the younger generation of scholars, if in-person (or at least hybrid) meetings were cease without being sure that the alternative was viable. As somebody in a small institution (where I was the sole philosopher and one of only a small number of philosophers of science within the immediate geographical region), being able to connect with people at the PSA was very important to my early career. Once I became more established and settled in my career, foregoing meetings became more of an option for me, although I will admit that it has meant that I feel less in-touch with new developments being pursued by the younger, 'frontier scholars' of the field.",
      "I'm inclined to disagree. But because the conference is biennial instead of annual, perhaps that would be a reason for me to answer more cautiously.",
      "As I said in response to a question above: 'There's a whole range of stuff that isn't just captured under 'fostering existing relationships' and 'initiating new relationships'. There's a level of feedback on one's work, productive discussion about others' work, and generally productive philosophical discussion which is simply impossible (in my experience) with online events. I'm thinking, for example, of the chats that spontaneously linger after Q&A is over, and continue over a drink or a meal, and the random encounters in the halls in between sessions, and so forth. Those are immensely valuable (socially and professionally) and impossible to replicate online. This past year+ has made me realize how much those interactions—even more so than the talks and Q&A—are the real substance of the benefit I get from conferences.' I think the PSA is an exceptionally valuable and important forum, in our discipline, for these sorts of interactions. It would be a huge loss to get rid of that.",
      "Community is essential for doing philosophy well, and community-building is best done in person.  I don't think even the best technology can change the fact that we are social organisms who relate as social organisms.  PSA is the premier conference for philosophy of science... or at least it used to be.  To continue to function as a community we need to meet face to face from time to time.",
      "There's a huge value-added by being physically in person with other like-minded scholars, for the longer chats in the hallways, at meals, over coffee and beer, &c. I could let APAs go and pick and choose my spots with online conferences, but I *really* want to keep going with in-person PSA meetings.",
      "I find it hard to judge how such a relatively large event would work online. Of course the environmental gains are especially big. And interaction works best in small groups. However, the PSA conference is special",
      "The PSA biennial conference is sufficiently general that the interactions it generates---between individuals would likely not seek out interaction on an online forum---are beneficial to the discipline as a whole. Additionally, it is only held once every 2 years. I would certainly advocate against moving to an annual conference, and would even advocate for the various APA conferences to become biennial events.  Even if we granted that an in-person PSA every other year was too much of a carbon footprint, I would argue that a PSA every 3 years is a better solution than moving them online.",
      "I take it that PSA has a contract with the hotel, so it will be financially liable.",
      "I don't have the data to evaluate the antecedent and have a hard time thinking about the consequent without the data. I don't think the PSA is more 'special' (i.e. privileged) relative to other conferences.",
      "I really do believe this. The PSA is a wonderful conference, and has made me feel part of a community in a way that most other conferences, both big and small, that I've been to simply have not.  There's something really edifying and inclusive about it -- and it's only every couple of years after all. ",
      "As noted above, I believe strongly that the benefits of in-person conferences are numerous and simply cannot be replicated in online formats.",
      "Again, I think it's important that it's the largest conference for philosophy of science. I think there are also things about the online experience that don't make sense for a large conference. It's the best time to see people from a wide variety of places and to have those informal interactions that make conferences fun. It's nice to go somewhere once every other year. The poster session is a very hard thing to translate online.",
      "On the one hand, I strongly believe that we should do our best to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. On the other, I feel that the in-person PSA conferences are very important opportunity for networking, which are hard to replace with virtual conferences without impairing their functions to facilitate networking.",
      "The social interactions that are possible are not completely compensated for by the remote interactions.  Informal conversations and personal relationship remain an integral part of intellectual life.",
      "On line communication is a hollow substitute for real embodied human communication. It's fine for limited, temporary purposes but it is dehumanizing as a replacement for genuine human interaction, which both scientific and philosophical communication requires.",
      "My sense is that PSA because it happens only every other year and has an international draw, the in-person meeting is justifiable.",
      "Many, but not all, conferences ought to retain the social component—and the biennial conference especially",
      "I honestly think that despite the drawbacks of a fully in-person conference, until we figure out how to have better online conferences--and we are very far--95% of every PSA should be in person.  This is based on the assumption that we can address the impact of international or even domestic travel using offsets.  If offsets are not enough or not appropriate, then I am not sure what to do.  Maybe PSA and EPSA should coordinate times and have some periods that are joint and online, but that the rest of each conference is in person.  We could do this with societies on other continents as well.",
      "What's special about PSA? Infrequency doesn't in itself make for a good argument.",
      "I see no reason that the talks must be in person and there are some advantages to virtual talks. The ability to record talks is a large benefit. I think the PSA biennial meeting serves a lot of professional functions via the components of the program other than the talks. I suspect that many of these functions can be accomplished virtually, but it will require some thinking about how to do this well. More than that, I think it will require a commitment from all of us to treat online conferences like we treat in-person conferences rather than popping in for a few talks and turning our video off.",
      "I'm more inclined to agree than disagree, for reasons that I can only sketch here. If we think that research in the philosophy of science is worthwhile, then we must think that to some extent it is worth expending resources on it that have alternative valuable uses. Those resources include the generation of some amount of CO2 (not only by traveling). I think that in-person conferences provide not only a forum for the scheduled exchange of ideas (which can be accomplished online) but also unplanned and unplannable opportunities for making new contacts and exchanging ideas. It is therefore possible in principle, and not implausible in practice, that the benefits of in-person conferences (in terms of promoting worthwhile research in the philosophy of science) exceed the costs (including in terms of carbon emissions). Carbon emissions have instrumental benefits (as well, of course, as costs), and the benefits need to be considered as well as the costs: they make good things possible that cannot be obtained without incurring other costs that also matter. I take it that we do not have reliable empirical estimates of the magnitudes of the costs and benefits in this particular case (in-person conferences). What I am resisting is the apriorism involved in assuming that the costs must exceed the benefits; there is no 'must' about it.",
      "PSA meetings only happen every two years and bring together a diversity of researchers unlike any other conference. Virtual conference participation cannot replicate the in person conference. I would be much less likely to attend.",
      "The PSA is, for me, one of the top three hubs for my intellectual life in a way that, e.g., the APA isn't. I think it's because of the size -- it's big enough to have most of the people I engage with in philosophy of science present, but small enough that there aren't a ton of people from other specialties I don't know. Of all the conferences I attend, it would be the last, or maybe one of the two last, opportunities to see my community that I would want to lose.",
      "It is a major conference that only takes place every other year.",
      "But I don't agree that more workshops should take place remotely.",
      "I believe there must be a focus for in person meetings due to the importance of contingent interaction (informal meetings and the unexpected things that happen when present at conferences) that cannot be easily duplicated online and to promote a sense of community. But we should also work on novel online approaches to facilitate ways to enhance the remote participant experience.",
      "If I'm honest, I'm not interested in fully virtual conferences. I've stopped agreeing to speak at them, and hardly attend them. If I so I am usually distracted. I've had a very hard time duplicating a virtual conference the networking opportunities, friend-building experiences, and emotional excitement that come with in person conferences. The PSA is the most important conference I attend; I do not think I would be as diverse and interesting of a scholar had I not (somewhat randomly) entered into certain conversations at the PSA meeting. I doubt these conversations would ever have taken place if the conference were online only. I think there should be an environmental review of what we can do better. I am willing to purchase offsets for my travel, to sponsor a graduate student's 'green' travel, to reduce food waste at the conference, to hold the conference someplace other than a boring hotel and conference center. I hope that the impact of such programs is investigated before the biannual conference is moved fully online. ",
      "The PSA is the most important conference and the benefits of physical attendance are especially high due to the presence of so many great friends and colleagues.",
      "Only when,if early career researchers benefit from in-person activities might enable them to build technical and non-technical capabilities by engaging with leaders in the specific discipline.",
      "The large scale social aspect of PSA is still important and cannot easily be replicated online.  We need fewer, better in-person meetings in the profession.  PSA is likely going to be one of those fewer, better meetings.",
      "I absolutely think virtual participation should be permitted as a basic precondition of future in-person conferences. But there are special reasons for big meetings, especially biennial ones, to have an in-person component.",
      "I'm unsure how significant a consideration this is. However, although geographical isolation makes it more difficult to attend the PSA and other large conferences, and although attendance involves air travel, these conferences often represent the only opportunity for those of us in the southern hemisphere to meet colleagues and make new connections in person. And if conferences have online options, our institutions will almost certainly cancel such travel entirely. Perhaps that is ultimately a good thing, but it is very hard to be a part of the international community as things already are.",
      "The PSA is such a big conference that the advantages of an in-person conference are less pronounced than in the case of smaller conferences or workshops. Thus, if anything I think there is a special reason to hold the PSA online or in a hybrid form, even though I believe that other conferences and workshops would loose more by making this move.",
      "In-person events are perhaps the only opportunities for junior scholars (especially those from less-than-stellar academic backgrounds) to get to know other scholars.",
      "Online is simply inferior.",
      "For most people, there is some conference that is their 'home' in the discipline, where they can go, and expect to see a good proportion of their friends and colleagues that they interact with in writing and online. The PSA serves that role for many people.",
      "Any in-person conference should include a required mechanism by which all of the carbon produced by the conference and each of the participants is verifiably offset 110% by any number of reduction/offset strategies. This will create a higher cost conference, but the higher cost will be and investment rather than an expense.",
      "I think we should promote a robust hybrid model with a recommendation/ restriction on time-flights for example.",
      "I don't think there is any special reason for PSA or the discipline that requires the biennial conference to be held in person. I think (and hope) that we will have a lot of opportunities for (safe) in-person contact at our home institutions or with shorter-distance in-person events.",
      "The PSA is the my only opportunity to meet with my North-American friends and colleagues. It would be a great loss not to have this any more. And one transatlantic flight every other year is not bringing about the world's end (in particular given that I am buying offsets for it).",
      "I have a hard time imagining how much the lack of social interactions will impact the overall experience/use of the conference. On the other hand, as it is I have no money to travel so I could not attend at all if it were not online.",
      "Hybrid meeting would be best. It is important especially to younger scholars to socialize. I personally don't like to travel that much anymore. More importantly, the hybrid mode would allow more papers, more participants, and less financial constraints. There is so much gate-keeping taking place due to the in-person format that restricts the number of papers to be presented. I've been myself in the PSA programme committee, and I have to say that apart from some very clear cases it was really difficult to decide what papers to accept and what to reject. There few if any outstanding papers, a few not acceptable ones, and the majority of the papers were well-written, and OK.",
      "Remote conferences, at present, diminish the attention and importance of contributions. Attendance is less appealing. This hurts the field. There is no back and forth questioning, and no opportunity for detailed communications outside of a session. Most of the attention goes to worrying about technical glitches. We don't meet new scholars.",
      "There are benefits to serendipitous interaction in an environment away from home.",
      "I think as a flagship conference for philosophy of science, the PSA meeting has an important professional function for the field. But I do think that if participants have to take long-distance flights to join PSA, the should commit to not taking other long-distance flights that year.",
      "The PSA meetings play an important role in fostering community among philosophers of science. I am introvert and a bit socially awkward, and I have never felt very comfortable or welcome at APA meetings. Over the years I have come to feel that PSA is a kind of academic home. That function can not be filled online.",
      "In-person (social) interaction is an important benefit of PSA meetings.",
      "The benefit gained from social interaction outside the talks is not possible with an exclusively online format.",
      "Perhaps it does not need to be biennial. Once every three years would probably suffice.",
      "Philosophical research can be lonely, but these conferences create a sense of community. Especially so the PSA, where philosophers of science make an effort to gather, and sometimes come even if they're not presenting. I would go as far as stating that the social/informal aspect of it is more important than the mere exchange of information or philosophical views. It's also important for the discipline to create a sense of community: one i more likely to be more charitable and fair to the papers of an author one has met in the flesh.",
      "I think we would lose what makes the PSA and other conferences special by hosting them online. In my opinion, the value in such meetings lies primarily in the kinds of informal interactions that they facilitate, for which the formal parts serve as jumping-off points. I also think there is so much more to gain by being in a room with people than being at home over zoom. My experience giving and attending zoom talks has left me feeling empty. Fostering and building community is best done in person.",
      "Unlike more specialized conferences, where a lot of the participants are already familiar with each other’s research, the breadth of PSA permits participants to learn about research they were not familiar with before or meet researchers they otherwise would not have an opportunity to meet.",
      "social part, and meeting colleagues."

    "question": "4) What in your view might be done to improve virtual academic events so that they produce more of the benefits of in-person meetings?",
    "responses": [
      "Ability to gather informally. An option to gather a group and break out to a different ‘room’ and talk.",
      "The gap is much too large.",
      "Difficult question. I think there may simply be inherent trade offs.",
      "Virtual social networking time can be created--but perhaps they can be improved by having specific 'break-out' rooms arranged around themes of research interest/topic so as to increase the likelihood of sparking potential collaborations",
      "more warm-up activities",
      "In my view, they have been maxxed out. The benefits of in-person meetings are already almost entirely outside of the actual talk-delivery. There is no functional way, after a year of trying, to get these benefits in a virtual format. They are just different formats, neither replaces the other.",
      "I think, sadly, that there is no feasible way to remedy the social shortfalls, at least not significantly.",
      "I take it that the main challenge is loosing in \"Initiating new collegial relationships\". I think that creating official time for continuing the conversation after Q&A is crucial. E.g., I just right now gave a talk, and would have loved keep talking to some people from the Q&A. But since it is online, one ends up putting other things in the calendar. So, keeping the standard Q&A session but allowing for then informal conversation after the session (perhaps creation rooms in zoom, one per talk given in the session; or allowing people to ask to be put in rooms [or have a shared space where they can agree to go an talk.])",
      "Including chat sessions in the coffee break.",
      "For a Pittsburgh Center conference, after the formal presentations, we were invited to gather.town for a virtual reception. I thought this worked well, except all the icons from which to choose looked like grammar school kids. I think such software should be explored to create more informal aspects at virtual meetings.",
      "It is better if talks are short in online meetings, and there is time for discussion. Breakout groups are good.",
      "The smaller and more continuous and familiar the group, the higher-quality the work. That has costs, too. The arrangement that works best seems to be like a research group--which is less accessible to those of us at non-PhD granting universities. It's also very different from a typical conference! One of the things that's wonderful about PSA is staying in touch with what's going on outside my immediate research area.",
      "Keep groups small enough, with rotating breakout discussion groups as needed, so that everybody can \"see\" everybody else. Reduce the amount of time when a shared slide takes up the whole screen. Facilitate discussion with a purpose.",
      "Events that are entirely virtual will never provide the benefits of in-person meetings, simply because an essential aspect of real-life meetings is being able to informally talk to people when you happen to bump into them, being able to engage with your audience in a talk (pick up facial expressions, seeing them laugh when a quip went well, seeing them get unfocused if they're bored which signals me to speed up this part of the talk, etc.), being able to engage with a speaker when sitting in the audience, etc. What would work better is hybrid events, such that at least there is a choice. I wouldn't mind if part of the events that I attend were online (so you can just attend even if it's hard to travel), but I need a good part to be in person to compensate for life online. If everything were to be online in the future, as it has been for more than a year now, That would have extremely dire consequences for the field.

      "Finding ways to foster new collegial relationships in ways that don't perpetuate the cliques and in-groups that already exist. Taking action to ensure inclusivity and well-being for all participants. This is not just an ideal we pay lip service to, but something that we need to actively work on. Planning smaller group discussion formats (e.g. @4-5 people) that allow real engagement is necessary. Large group discussions do not foster engagement but simply platform one or two people who often dominate conversations.",
      "I think that having optional social hours for participants of conferences is a good idea, currently implemented by some conferences but not all. I also think that people need to consider \"zoom fatigue\" might be worse than regular conference fatigue - and therefore not schedule events that require a lot of zoom time at once without a break. Spreading conferences out over multiple days, even nonconsecutive days, has worked really well at some conferences, in my opinion (without needing to travel, this becomes a possibility that we didn't have before). I also think that there is no great solution to the problem of time differences between different places in the world for online talks, but this needs to be something that conference planners take into consideration regularly. A special challenge for online conferences is the fact that people at home aren't able to \"pause\" their other personal/work responsibilities as easily for a conference they're attending from home, like they would for an in person conference; I think this requires a culture shift around what it means to attend a conference or other event, and the understanding that people might be only participating some of the time or may need to multitask with their other responsibilities.",

I certainly am very worried about narratives that depict online meetings are more inclusive than in-person meetings. Both types of meetings have advantages, and include different types of people.",
      "This might sound strange, but I think that the best thing is to stop trying to have virtual events 'replicate' in-person meetings. Instead, I would suggest that we try to identify when virtual events succeed (focus on information transmission, clear questions & decisions, more transactional engagements), and thereby free up space for in-person events to focus on interactions where subtlety, nuance, human connection, etc. are critical. For example, could a conference have the talks occur virtually 1-2 weeks prior to a (shorter-than-usual) in-person event that primarily focuses on group discussions? (Another issue (in my experience) is that people usually don't block off their calendars for virtual events in the same way that they do when they travel for something in-person. But improving that dimension (so that people are fully engaged in the virtual event) would require a sociological change within the academic community.)",

      "Better chairing practices; clearer speaking guidelines. I find that domination of discussion is a bigger issue online because there are fewer social cues for someone to realize that they should stop talking or for other people to express that they do not approve of what's going on. Active chairing helps a lot. I've found that 'official talks' are often actively chaired in a helpful way, but unofficial chats, such as individual breakout rooms during the PSA poster session, are often not, and consequently are more prone to domination problems.",
      "I think more social time would be best, but I want to stress that I think with the current technology it would be pretty much impossible to get even a reasonable fraction of the benefits of the social time of in-person meetings. I think in-person meetings are important for the health and productivity of the research community.",
      "It really helped to have chat rooms where we could meet and interact. This was not the same as attending in person, but real work got done and people who could not attend in person under even the best of circumstances (i.e. folks with mobility disabilities) were able to participate fully.",

They are brittle, they are extremely tiring, they fail to foster any sense of community, they elicit a weaker engagement than in person activities, they are far from being neutral for the environment (electricity and data storage are far from green). they can complement but can't replace in person activities, and I hope the PSA will not replace its in person meetings with them.",
      "Strategically structure them in different ways, with fewer long-form talks",
      "I would be more than happy to brainstorm this with a diverse group of people. I hosted such a conference, and we did our best to try and replicate these benefits.

Honestly I don't see why a professional relationship can't be fostered that way. Things would be different if I were looking for friends or dating -- and I don't mean that to sound facetious, lots of people make really significant personal and romantic relationships at conferences! But I'm not; I am however looking for people to have big philosophical discussions with, and I can have them online just fine. I suppose that something that needs addressed is a way for people to talk 'off the record'. Other than the Zoom chat function, I don't see an obvious good way for people to easily have conversations of a more private nature (which can be important for all sorts of reasons). ",

Thi Nguyen had a great Facebook post and then blog post (which I can't find at the moment) on some of the things done at an aesthetics conference that seemed to work very well.  Whatever we do, we should be aware that in-person human communication is a high-bandwidth interaction, involving dimensions that we might not be conscious of.  I don't think that with current technology we can ever get that back, completely, in an online conference, but we can make them better than they are now.",
      "I think applications like Gather are not bad for more organic mingling and discussion. I think that people also need to commit themselves to being present and fully participating in virtual conferences. It is so easy to attend one or two talks at a virtual conference and to keep your video off and then go about the rest of your day. I think it is possible to recreate much of the in-person components, but to do that people need to be committed to blocking off their day and attending social components of a conference and scheduling meetings with other participants. Maybe a conference could help facilitate and encourage meetings by having a directory of participants with emails as well as designated time in the conference program for one-one-one meetings.

      "One feature I appreciated at The Science of Consciousness 2020, held virtually last September by the University of Arizona, was a system which all conference attendees logged into to watch talks, and which included an instant-messaging application. I found a lot of people sent messages using this service, and I had a number of productive conversations through it. Using this service felt less formal and easier than looking up someone's email and reaching out to them that way. Also, it being a conference-only ap created a sense that you were somehow in the room over drinks and this was your chance to connect. Beyond this, I think adding more opportunities to log in early, or hang around after, a talk or event, in order to informally socialize over Zoom in smaller breakout rooms could simulate those short post-talk hallway conversations we all miss.",

I'm just not sure we have the technology, yet, to allow these events to have the social aspects of live events. That's OK, we just need to find other ways to get those needs met. Honestly, I find that my collegial relationships have improved with anyone who enjoys email as a medium. I've taken up several regular communication flows via email, including one with a new colleague, and they have been quite valuable. More valuable than any breakout session in Zoom.",
      "In my view, virtual academic events will never produce the benefits of in-person meetings. So many of the subtle social cues are absent for being able to make informal connections with people.
